== The Modern Operating System

[.slider]
* Today millions of people create apps by writing code that runs in a
protected sandbox and manipulates a rich windowing environment...
* ...except that code is _JavaScript_ and the environment is the _web browser_.

<<<

At some level, the web browser is the modern operating system and has many of
the features and responsibilities that we associate with traditional
operating systems:

[.slider]
* Multiplexing resources
** The CPU, sockets, memory, etc.
* Protecting applications from each other
** Preventing information leakage between different tabs, enforcing the same
origin policy
* Providing useful abstractions
** Events, the document object model, etc.

== Browsers v. Operating Systems

So what's a core difference between the OS and web browsers?

[.slider]
* Operating systems were designed and implemented to be operating systems...
* ...but web browsers were designed as applications and have kind of had the
OS responsibility added to them over time.
* So browsers may not make very good operating systems!
