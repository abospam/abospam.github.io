== Review: Interrupt Handling

[.slider]
.When an interrupt happens the CPU:
. Enters privileged mode,
. records state necessary to allow the operating system to process the
interrupt
. jumps to a fixed memory location and begins executing instructions.

[.nooutline]
== Review: Making System Calls

To access the kernel system call interface an application:

[.slider]
. arranges arguments to the system call in an agreed-on place where the
kernel can find them, typically in registers or on its stack,
. loads a number identifying the system call it wants the kernel to
perform into a pre-determined register, and
. executes the `syscall` instruction.

[.nooutline]
== [.small]#Review: Software Exceptions v. Software Interrupts#

[.slider]
.*Interrupts* are *voluntary*.
* Think of the CPU as saying to the kernel: "The `/bin/true` process
would like your assistance."

[.slider]
.*Exceptions* are *non-voluntary*.
* Think of the CPU as saying to the kernel: "I need some help with this
`/bin/false` process. It just tried to divide by zero and I think it needs
to be terminated."

== [.small]#Now: Why Are We Doing All This Stuff?#

* CPU multiplexing: a historical perspective.
* Preemption and context switching.

== CPU Limitations: Number

[.slider]
.(Historically) There is only one! Why?
* Potentially the most *expensive* and *complex* component of the
system!

[.slider]
.(Recently) You may have many. Why?
* Multiple cores have emerged as a solution to *thermal- and
energy-management issues* caused by transistor density.
* But generally, even if you have more than one, there are *fewer* cores
than *tasks* to be run.

== CPU Limitations: Number

image::figures/threads/multicore.svg[width="50%", role="expand"]

== CPU Limitations

[.slider]
.How does the CPU compare to other parts of the system—memory, disks, etc.?
* It is *way faster!*

[.slider]
* Faster than *memory*—usually addressed on the processor through
out-of-order execution.
* *Way faster* than *disk*—addressed by the operating system.
* *Way faster* than *you!*—partially addressed by the operating system.
(Nothing the operating system can _really_ do about your limitations.)

== Human Perceptual Limitations

Can you express these delays to a 1 GHz processor?

[.slider]
* 15 ms "rule of thumb": [.slide]#*15,000,000* clock cycles!#
* 40 ms based on 25 frames-per-second for "smooth" video: [.slide]#*40,000,000*
clock cycles!#
* 100 ms was the rule for old telephone systems, the delay point after
which human conversation patterns start to break down: [.slide]#*100,000,000*
clock cycles!#

== Ancient History

The Harvard Mark I computer

== The Garden

[.slider]
* Long long ago, in a land before time, computers did not multitask.
They did *one thing at a time*
* That one thing had complete access to the machine in was running on.
* The operating system--if there was one--was really just a library of
routines to make programming easier. All *abstractions*, no
*multiplexing*.

== The Fall of Computing

[.slider]
* At some point *more people* wanted to use the computer. That was
annoying, because the geeks didn't have it all to themselves anymore,
but they just told people to form a line.

image::figures/threads/peopleinline.svg[title="People in Line", height="300"]

== The Further Fall of Computing

[.slider]
* At some point people wanted to *interact* with the computer, even
multiple people interacting with the computer *at the same time*! Now
what were the geeks to do?

== Give the Geeks Some Credit

[.slider]
* They solved these problems by building *operating systems*. Scheduling
evolved to meet the needs of computer users.

== The Rise of Multiprocessing

== The Rise of Multiprocessing

image::figures/threads/computerevolution-batch.svg[title="Batch Scheduling", height="300"]

== Problems with Batch Scheduling

[.slider]
.Recall one of the "problems" with the CPU
* It is *faster* than other system components!

[.slider]
.What problem does this create for simple batch scheduling?
* *Inefficiency!* Usage of slower parts of the system will cause the
CPU to stall waiting for them to finish.

== Solution: Context Switching

image::figures/threads/computerevolution-cooperative.svg[title="Context Switching",height="300"]

== Birth of the Operating System

[.slider]
* Operating systems emerged partly to *hide delays* caused by slow
devices to *keep the processor active*.
* Hiding processor delays requires only *cooperative* scheduling:
threads only stop running when they require a long-latency operation.

== [.small]#Supporting Multiple Interactive Users#

[.slider]
.Supporting multiple users requires the notion that multiple tasks are running *simultaneously* or *concurrently*, either:
. One task per user for multiple users, or
. multiple tasks for a single user, or
. multiple tasks for multiple users.

== The Illusion of Concurrency

[.slider]
.*How is this accomplished?*
* Remember human perceptual limits?

image:figures/threads/concurrency-2.svg[width="100%"]

[.slider]
* The processors *rapidly switches between tasks* creating the notion of
concurrency!
* We refer to these transitions as *context switches*.

== Implementing Context Switching

[.slider]
.First problem: *how does the operating system get control?*
. Hardware interrupts.
. Software interrupts.
. Software exceptions.

[.slide]
--
*But what if these things don't happen?*
--

== Timer Interrupts

[.slider]
* *Timer interrupts* generated by a timer device ensure that the
operating system regains control of the system at regular intervals.
* Timer interrupts are the basis of *preemptive* scheduling: the
operating system doesn't wait for the thread to stop running, instead it
*preempts* it.
* Rest of interrupt handling is unchanged.

== The Illusion of Concurrency

[.slider]
* Timer interrupts mean that a running thread may be stopped *at any
time.*
* When the thread restarts we want it to _appear_ that nothing has
happened, that execution was not interrupted.
** Of course other parts of the system might have changed, but the CPU
state should be *identical*.
* How do we do this?

== Saving Thread State

[.slider]
.What does thread state consist of?
* *Registers*
* *Stack*

[.slide]
--
We rely on memory protection to keep the stack unchanged until we
restart the thread.
--

== OS/161 Example

[.slider]
* Saving thread state is the *first thing* that happens when the
interrupt service routine is triggered. (Why?)
* Saved state is sometimes known as a *trap frame*.

== Saving Context: OS/161 Example

`kern/arch/mips/locore/exception-mips1.S`

image:figures/threads/contextswitch-assembly.svg[height="400"]

== Trap Frame: OS/161 Example

`kern/arch/mips/include/trapframe.h`

image:figures/threads/trapframe.svg[height="400"]

== Context Switching

[.slider]
.Threads switch to a separate kernel stack when executing in the kernel. Why?
* The kernel doesn't *trust* (or want to *pollute*) the user thread's
stack.

[.slider]
.Do you think that you can find the corresponding OS/161 code that returns from an exception? What does it do?
* *Yes you can find that code.* All the code is belong to you.
* Exception return reloads the saved register state and then calls the
MIPS instructions `rfe`, or return from exception.
