== Today

* Introduction to stable storage.
* From *disks* to *files*.
* Spinning disk operation basics.

[.nooutline]
== $ cat announce.txt

[.slider]
* https://www.ops-class.org/asst/3/[ASST3 core map] due Friday, April 8th @ 5PM.
* `test161` https://test161.ops-class.org/leaders[leader boards] are live.

== Virtual Memory: Questions?

[.small]
== SSDs v. HDDs

[.slider]
.Some important terminology:
* *stable storage*: storage that does not lose its contents when the
computer is turned off.

[.slider]
.Today we have two main categories of stable storage with very different characteristics:
* *HDD*, *spinning disk* or *hard drive*: a stable storage device
constructed of rotating magnetic platters. (HDD stands for Hard Disk
Drive.)
* *SSD* or *Flash drive*: a stable storage device constructed of
non-moving non-volatile memory.

[.slider]
.HDDs are _bigger_, _slower_, and _cheaper_ than SSDs.
* $0.10 per GB (HDD) v. $1 per GB (projected for SSDs in 2012).
* Today: $0.07 per GB (HDD) v. $0.15 per GB (SSD)&mdash;not that bad!

[.slide]
--
If I am not clear about what type of storage I am referring to *please
ask*. The differences between HDDs and SSDs lead to very different
system designs!
--

== Why Study Spinning Disks?

[.slider]
* Flash is the future!
* But HDDs are still around.

[.slider]
* Hierarchical file systems are dead. Long live search!
* But local search is still built on top of hierarchical file systems today.

[.slider]
* New storage technologies will completely alter the way that operating
systems store data.
* But new solutions will benefit from, and probably resemble, earlier
efforts.

[.slide]
--
Let's focus on the *systems design principles* at work here and admire
the maturity of file system design. (And we won't linger here.)
--

== Disk Parts

[.slider]
* *Platter:* a circular flat disk on which magnetic data is stored.
Constructed of a rigid non-magnetic material coated with a _very thin_
layer of magnetic material. Can have data written on both sides.
* *Spindle:* the drive shaft on which multiple *platters* are mounted
and spun between 4200–15,000 RPM.
* *Head:* the actuator that reads and writes data onto the magnetic
surface of the *platters* while rotating at tens of nanometers over the
platter surface.

== Disk Part Diagram

== Disk Locations

[.slider]
* *Track:* think of a lane on a race track running around the platter.
* *Sector:* resembles a slice of pie cut out of a single platter.
* *Cylinder:* imagine the intersection between a cylinder and the set of
platters. Composed of a set of vertically-aligned tracks on all
platters.
* Ah forget it. *To the diagram!*

== Spinning Disks Are Different

Spinning disks are fundamentally different from the other system
components we have discussed so far.

[.slider]
* Difference in *kind*: disks *move*!
* Difference in *degree*: disks are *slow*!
* Difference in *integration*: disks are *devices*, and less
tightly-coupled to the abstractions built on top of them.

== Disks Move, Ergo Disks Are Slow

[.slider]
* Electronics time scale: the time necessary for electrons to flow from
one part of the computer or chip to another. [.slide]*Very fast!*
* Mechanics time scale: the time necessary for a physical object to move
gently and precisely from one point to another point. [.slide]*Comparatively
slow!*

== Disks Move, Ergo Disks Fail

[.slider]
.Disks can fail by parts:
* Many disks ship with sectors that are already broken. The operating
system—or disk software—detect and ignore these sectors.
* Sectors may also fail over time, potentially resulting in data loss.

[.slider]
.Disks can fail *catastrophically*:
* A *head crash* occurs when a jolt or violent event sends the disk
heads crashing into the magnetic surface, scraping off material and
destroying the platter.
* When this happens, you have about 20 seconds to say goodbye.

== Head Crash

== Handling Failures

[.slider]
* We will discuss RAID, a clever way to use multiple disks to create a
more reliable and better-performing device that looks like a single
disk.
* Many interesting approaches to fault tolerance began with people
thinking about spinning disks--and then have been applied elsewhere.

== Disks Are Slow

Disks frequently bottleneck other parts of the operating system.
[.slider]
.Operating systems play some of our usual games with disks to try and hide disk latency.
* Use the *past to predict the future*.
* Use a *cache*.
* *Procrastination*.

[.slide]
--
Contrast with memory latencies which are usually hidden *transparently* by
the processor (through out-of-order execution). Here the operating system
software is directly involved.
--

== Sources of Slowness

Reading or writing from the disk requires a series of steps, each of
which is a potential source of latency.

[.slider]
. *Issue the command.* The operating system has to tell the device
what to do, the command has to cross the device interconnect (IDE, SATA,
etc.), and the drive has to select which head to use.
. *Seek time.* The drive has to move the heads to the appropriate
track.
. *Settle time.* The heads have to stabilize on the (very narrow)
track.
. *Rotation time.* The platters have to rotate to the position where
the data is located.
. *Transfer time.* The data has to be read and transmitted back across
the interconnect into system memory.

== What Improves?

[.slider]
* *Interconnect speeds*: [.slide]#seem to be increasing. (SATA-6, anyone?)#
* *Seek times*: [.slide]#_not improving_ rapidly. This is the moving physical
objects part.#
* *Rotation speeds*: [.slide]#can vary between devices but may not be the primary
source of latency anyway. Physical limitations come in to play here as
well.#

== The Already-Came I/O Crisis

[.slider]
.Two factors collide:
* Hard drive densities and capacities soar, encouraging users to save
more stuff and increasing I/O demand.
* Seek times limit the ability of disks to keep up.

== The Already-Came I/O Crisis

[.slider]
* So three orders of magnitude increase in capacity...
* But only two in speed.
* And think about what happened to processors during that time!

== File Systems To The Rescue

[.slider]
.Low-level disk interface is messy and very limited:
* Requires reading and writing entire 512-byte blocks.
* No notion of files, directories, etc.

[.slide]
--
File systems take this limited block-level device and create the *file
abstraction* almost _entirely in software_.
--

[.slider]
* Compared to the CPU and memory that we have studied previously *more*
of the file abstraction is implemented in software.
* This explains the plethora of available file systems: [.spelling_exception]#ext2,3 and 4,
reiserfs, NTFS, jfs, lfs, xfs#, etc.
* This is probably why many systems people have a soft spot for file
systems even if they seem a bit outdated these days.

== What About Flash?

No moving parts! Great! We can eliminate a lot of the complexity of
modern file systems. Yippee!

[.slider]
.Except that...
* Have to erase an entire large chunk before we can rewrite it.
* And it wears out faster that magnetic drives, and can wear unevenly
if we are not careful.

[.slide]

Sigh... things are sounding complicated again.
