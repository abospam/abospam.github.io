== Today

* Producer-consumer buffer problem.
* `exec()`
* ``wait()``/``exit()``

[.nooutline]
== $ cat announce.txt

* Do ASST1!

== Producer-Consumer

.*Problem description*:
* Producer and consumer share a fixed-size buffer.
* Producer can add items to the buffer *if it is not full*.
* Consumer can withdraw items from the buffer *if it is not empty*.

[.slider]
.What do we want to ensure?
* Producer *must wait* if the buffer is full.
* Consumer *must wait* if the buffer is empty.
* Producers should not be sleeping if there is room in the buffer.
* Consumers should not be sleeping if there are items in the buffer.

.What synchronization primitive is a good fit for this problem?
* *Condition variables*: I have a variable (`count`) and conditions that
require waiting (full, empty).

Looks good, right?

.Any time you call `cv_wait` *you must* call `cv_signal` or `cv_broadcast`!
* *But where?* Where does the condition change?

Approaching full victory. But why not use `cv_signal`?

== Using the Right Tool

[.slider]
* Most problems can be solved with a *variety* of synchronization
primitives.
* However, there is usually *one primitive* that is more appropriate
than the others.
* You will have a chance to practice picking synchronization primitives
for ASST1, and throughout the class.

== Approaching Synchronization Problems

[.slider]
. Identify the constraints.
. Identify shared state.
. Choose a primitive.
. Pair waking and sleeping.
. Look out for multiple resource allocations: can lead to deadlock.
. Walk through simple examples and corner cases *before* beginning to code.

== Review: After `fork()`

[source,c,role='small']
----
returnCode = fork();
if (returnCode == 0) {
  # I am the child.
} else {
  # I am the parent.
}
----

[.small.slider]
* The child thread returns executing at the exact same point that its
parent called `fork()`.
** With one exception: `fork()` returns *twice*, the PID to the parent and
0 to the child.
* All contents of memory in the parent and child are identical.
* Both child and parent have the same files open at the same position.
** *But, since they are sharing file handles changes to the file
offset made by the parent/child will be reflected in the child/parent!*

[.nooutline]
== Review: Issues with `fork()`

[.slider]
.Copying all that state is expensive!
* Especially when the next thing that a process frequently does is
start load a new binary which destroys most of the state `fork()` has
carefully copied!

[.slider]
.Several solutions to this problem:
* *Optimize existing semantics*: through copy-on-write, a clever
memory-management optimization we will discuss in several weeks.
* *Change the semantics*: `vfork()`, which will fail if the child does anything other than
immediately load a new executable.
** Does not copy the address space!

[.nooutline]
== Review: The Tree of Life

[.slider]
* `fork()` establishes a parent-child relationship between two process at
the point when each one is created.
* The `pstree` utility allows you to visualize these relationships.

== Let's Go On...

* Questions about `fork()`?

== $ wait %1 # Process lifecycle

[.slider]
* *Change:* `exec()`
* *Death:* `exit()`
* *The Afterlife:* `wait()`

== Groundhog Day

Is `fork()` enough?

== Change: `exec()`

[.slider]
* The `exec()` family of system calls replaces the calling process with a
new process loaded from a file.
* The executable file must contain a complete *blueprint* indicating how
the address space should look when `exec()` completes.
** What should the contents of memory be?
** Where should the first thread start executing?
* Linux and other UNIX-like systems use *ELF* (Executable and Linkable
Format) as the standard describing the information in the executable
file is structured.

== [.spelling_exception]#$ /lib/ld-linux.so.2#

image::figures/ldlinux.svg[width="100%"]

== `exec()` Argument Passing

[.slider]
* The process calling `exec()` passes arguments to the process that will
replace it *through the kernel.*
** The kernel retrieves the arguments from the process after the call to
`exec()` is made.
** It then pushes them in to the memory of the process where the
replacement process can find them when it starts executing.
** This is where main gets `argc` and `argv`!
* `exec()` also has an interesting return, almost the dual of `fork()`:
`exec()` *never* returns!

== `exec()` File Handle Semantics

[.slider]
* By convention exec does *not* modify the file table of the calling
process! Why not?
* Remember *pipes*?
** Don't undo all the hard work that `fork()` put in to duplicating the
file table!

== Our Simple Shell

Disclaimer: this is C-like pseudo-code. It will not compile or run!
(But it's not far off.)

[source,c]
----
while (1) {
  input = readLine();
  returnCode = fork();
  if (returnCode == 0) {
    exec(input);
  }
}
----

== `exec()` Challenges

[.slider]
* The most challenging part of `exec()` is making sure that, on failure,
`exec()` can return to the calling process!
** Can't make destructive changes to the parent's address space until we
are _sure_ that things will success.
** Of course, the process is just an abstraction anyway and that
provides a lot of flexibility: can prepare a separate address space and
just swap it in when we're done.

== `exit()` # End of Life Issues

[.slider]
* What's missing here? *Death!*
* Processes choose the moment of their own end by calling `exit()`.
* As we discussed earlier a processes passes an *exit code* to the
`exit()` function.
* What happens to this exit code?

== `wait()` # The Afterlife

[.slider]
* When a process calls `exit()` the kernel holds the *exit code*, which
can be retrieved by the exiting child's *parent*.
* The parent retrieves this exit code by calling `wait()`, the last of the
primary process-related system calls.
** And the one that stubbornly refuses to fit into my lifecycle
metaphor.


[.nooutline]
== Next Time

[.slider]
* At this point we will head from outside looking in—or at the top of
the world looking down—and get deep inside the trenches to examine the
*thread* abstraction.
* Tentatively:
** One week on interrupts, kernel privileges, context switching and
threading.
** One week on scheduling.
