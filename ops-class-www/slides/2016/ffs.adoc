== Today

* Journaling
* The Berkeley Fast File System (FFS)
* Log-structured file systems (LFS)

[.nooutline]
== $ cat announce.txt

[.slider]
* Do ASST3!
* Due to a goof on my part midterms will be returned later this week.
(Sorry.)

== Another Approach to Consistency

[.slider]
* What's _not_ atomic? [.slide]#Writing *multiple* disk blocks.#
* What _is_ atomic? [.slide]#Writing *one* disk block.#

== Journaling

[.slider]
* Track pending changes to the file system in a special area on disk
called the *journal*.
* Following a failure, *replay* the journal to bring the file system back
to a consistent state.

Creation example:
____
Dear Journal, here's what I'm going to do today:

1.  Allocate inode 567 for a new file.
2.  Associate data blocks 5, 87, and 98 with inode 567.
3.  Add inode 567 to the directory with inode 33.
4.  That's it!

== Journaling: Checkpoints

[.slider]
.What happens when we flush cached data to disk?
* Update the journal!
* This is called a *checkpoint*.

[.slide.small]
____
Dear Journal, here's what I'm going to do today:

1.  [line-through]*Allocate inode 567 for a new file.*
2.  [line-through]*Associate data blocks 5, 87, and 98 with inode 567.*
3.  [line-through]*Add inode 567 to the directory with inode 33.*
4.  [line-through]*That's it!*

Dear Journal, I already did everything mentioned above! Checkpoint!
____

== Journaling: Recovery

[.slider]
.What happens on recovery?
* Start at the *last checkpoint* and work forward, updating on-disk
structures as needed.

[.slide.small]
____
Dear Journal, I already did everything mentioned above! Checkpoint!

Dear Journal, here's what I'm going to do today:

1. Allocate inode 567 for a new file. [.slide]*Did this already!*
2. Associate data blocks 5, 87, and 98 with inode 567. [.slide]*Didn't do
this... OK, done!*
3.  Add inode 567 to the directory with inode 33. [.slide]*Didn't do this
either! OK, done.*
4.  That's it! [.slide]*All caught up!*
____

== Journaling: Recovery

[.slider]
.What about incomplete journal entries?
* These are *ignored* as they may leave the file system in an incomplete
state.

[.slide.small]

What would happen if we processed the following incomplete journal entry?
____
Dear Journal, here's what I'm going to do today:

1.  Allocate inode 567 for a new file.
2.  Associate data blocks 5, 87, and 98 with inode 567.

== Journaling: Implications

Observation: *metadata* updates (allocate inode, free data block, add
to directory, etc.) can be represented compactly and probably written to
the journal *atomically*.

[.slider]
.What about data blocks themselves changed by write()?
* We could *include them in the journal* meaning that each data block
would potentially be written _twice_ (ugh).
* We could *exclude them from the journal* meaning that file system
structures are maintained but not file data.

== Caching, Consistency: Questions?

== The Berkeley Fast File System

[.slider]
* First included in the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) UNIX
release in *August, 1982.*
* Developed by Kirk McKusick. (*One guy!*)
* FFS is the basis of the Unix File System (UFS), which is still in use
and still developed by Kirk today.

== Exploiting Geometry

FFS made _many_ contributions to file system design. Some were lasting,
others less so.

[.slider]
* The less lasting features had to do with tailoring file system
performance to disk geometry.

[.slider]
.What are some geometry-related questions that file systems might try to address?
* Where to put *inodes*?
* Where to put *data blocks*, particularly where with respect to the
inodes that they are linked to?
* Where to put *related* files?
* What files are *likely* to be related?

[.small]
== Introducing Standard File System Features

FFS also responded to many problems with earlier file system implementations
and introduced many common features we have already learned about.

[.slider]
.Early file systems had a *small block size* of 512 B.
* FFS introduced larger *4K blocks*.

[.slider]
.Early file systems had no way to allocate *contiguous blocks* on disk.
* FFS introduced an ordered free block list allowing contiguous or
near-contiguous block allocation.

[.slider]
.Early file systems lacked many features.
* FFS added *symbolic links*, *file
locking*, unrestricted *file name lengths* and user *quotas*.

== What's Close On Disk?

[.slider]
.Two enemies of closeness:
. Lateral movement, or seek times. This is *major*.
. Rotational movement or delay. This is *minor*.

== Seek Planning: Cylinder Groups

*Cylinder group:* All of the data that can be read on the disk without
moving the head. Comes from *multiple platters*.

[.slider]
.On FFS each *cylinder group* has:
* A (backup) copy of the superblock.
* A cylinder-specific header with superblock-like statistics.
* A number of inodes.
* Data blocks.
* It's almost like it's own mini file system!

[.nooutline]
== It's Own Mini File System!

== Groups!

image::figures/disks/debugfs-show_super_stats2.svg[width="90%"]

== Rotational Planning

FFS superblock contained detailed disk geometry information allowing FFS to
attempt to perform better block placement.

[.slider]
.Example:
* Imagine that the speed at which the heads can read information off
the disk is greater than the speed at which the disk can return data to
the operating system.
* So the disk *cannot* read consecutive blocks off of the disk. Can't
read 0, 1, 2, 3, etc., because after I finish transferring Block 0 the
heads are over a different block.
* FFS will incorporate this delay and attempt to lay out consecutive
blocks for a single file as 0, 3, 6, 9, etc.
* *Wow/[.spelling_exception]#eww#!*

== Back to the Future

[.slider]
* Does this stuff matter anymore?
* If not, why not, and is it a good thing that it doesn't?

== Hardware Weenies v. Software Weenies

Continuing battle for the soul of your computer between the forces of light
(us/them) and darkness (them/us).

[.slider]
.Who should be responsible for making the slow disk fast?
* *Hardware:* *fixed* and *fast*.
* *Software:* *flexible* and *slow*.

== Put the OS in Control

[.small]
____
*OS*—Put this block exactly where I tell you to right now, slave!

*Disk*—Yes master.
____

[.slider]
.*Pros:*
* OS has better *visibility* into workloads, users, relationships,
consistency requirements, etc. This information can improve performance.

[.slider]
.*Cons:*
* Operating systems are slow and buggy.

== Leave it to Hardware

[.slide]
____
*OS*--Oh disk, you are so clever. Here's some data! I trust you'll do the
right thing with it.

*Disk*—I *am* so clever.
____

[.slider]
.*Pros:*
* The device knows much more about itself than the operating system can
be expected to.
* Device buffers and caches are closer to the disk.

[.slider]
.*Cons:*
* Device opaqueness may violate guarantees that the operating system is
trying to provide.

== FFS Continues To Improve

[.slider]
.*Block sizing:* continues to respond to changes to average file sizes.
* Small blocks: less internal fragmentation, more seeks.
* Large blocks: more internal fragmentation, fewer seeks.

[.slider]
.Co-locating inodes and directories.
* *Problem:* accessing directory contents is slow.
* *Solution:* jam inodes for directory _into_ directory file itself.

[.slide]
--
Separate solution to consistency called *soft updates*, which has
recently been combined with journaling. (Worth its own lecture.)

[.nooutline]
== Next Time

* Log-structured file systems.
