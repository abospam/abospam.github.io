[.nooutline]
== Today

* Caching and consistency.
* Journaling.

[.nooutline]
== $ cat announce.txt

* Mid-semester grades will be released today. They will include ASST1, all
ASST2 submissions as of this AM (including late ones), and the midterm--but
_not_ ASST3.

[.nooutline]
== The Next Few Classes

Moving forward we'll have a mixture of traditional lectures as well as
meetings when we review an operating system research paper.

* Today: caching and consistency.
* Monday: FFS and LFS.
* Wednesday: RAID. Please read the paper and look at the online resources posted
on Discourse early next week.

== Making File Systems Fast

[.slider]
.How do we make a big slow thing look faster?
* *Use a cache!* (Put a smaller, faster thing in front of it.)

[.slide]
--
In the case of the file system the smaller, faster thing is *memory*.
We call the memory used to cache file system data the *buffer cache*.
--

== Putting Spare Memory To Work

[.slider]
.Operating systems use memory:
* *as memory* (duh), but also
* to cache file data in order to improve performance.

[.slider]
.These two uses of memory *compete* with each other.
* *Big* buffer cache, *small* main memory: [.slide]#file access is fast, but
potential thrashing in the memory subsystem...#
* *Small* buffer cache, *large* main memory: [.slide]#little swapping occurs but
file access is extremely slow.#

[.slide]
--
On Linux the `swappiness` kernel parameter controls how aggressively
the operating system prunes unused process memory pages and hence the
balance between memory and buffer cache.

== Above the File System

[.slider]
.What do we cache?
* *Entire files and directories!*

.What is the buffer cache interface?
* `open`, `close`, `read`, `write`. (Same as the file system call interface.)

[.small]
== Above the File System: Operations

[.slider]
.`open`
* Pass down to underlying file system.

[.slider]
.`read`
* If file is not in the buffer cache, pass down to underlying
file system and load contents into the buffer cache.
* If the file is in the cache, return the cached contents.

[.slider]
.`write`
* If file is not in the buffer cache, pass load contents into the
buffer cache and then modify them.
* If the file is in the cache, modify the cached contents.

[.slider]
.`close`
* Remove from the cache (if necessary) and flush contents through the file system.

== Above the File System: Pros and Cons

[.slider]
.Pros:
* Buffer cache sees file operations, may lead to better prediction or
performance.

.Cons:
* Hides many file operations from the file system, preventing it from
providing consistency guarantees.
* Can't cache file system metadata: inodes, superblocks, etc.

== Below the File System

[.slider]
.What do we cache?
* *Disk blocks!*

[.slider]
.What is the buffer cache interface?
* `readblock`, `writeblock`. (Same as the disk interface.)

== Below the File System: Pros and Cons

[.slider]
.Pros:
* Can cache all blocks including file system data structures, inodes,
superblocks, etc.
* Allows file system to see all file operations even if they eventually
hit the cache.

[.slider]
.Cons:
* Cannot observe file semantics or relationships.

[.slide]
--
This is what modern operating systems do.

== Review: Data Blocks: Multilevel Index

Observation: [.slide]*most* files are small, but [.slide]*some* can get very large.

[.slider]
.Have inode store:
* some pointers to blocks, which we refer to as *direct* blocks.
* some pointers to blocks containing pointers to blocks, which we refer
to as *indirect* blocks.
* some pointers to blocks containing pointers to blocks containing
pointers to blocks, which we refer to as *doubly indirect* blocks.
* etc...

== Buffer Cache v. Process Pages

.Operating systems use memory:
* *as memory* (duh), but also
* to cache file data in order to improve performance.

[.slider]
.These two uses of memory *compete* with each other.
* *Big* buffer cache, *small* main memory: [.slide]#file access is fast, but
potential thrashing in the memory subsystem...#
* *Small* buffer cache, *large* main memory: [.slide]#little swapping occurs but
file access is extremely slow.#

[.nooutline]
== Buffer Cache Location

[.slider]
.Where is the buffer cache typically located? Above or below the file system?
* Below.

[.slider]
.What does the buffer cache store?
* Complete disk blocks, including file system metadata.

[.nooutline]
== File System Structures: Questions?

== Caching and Consistency

[.slider]
.How can the cache cause consistency problems?
* Objects in the cache are lost on failures!

[.slide]
--
Remember: almost *every* file system operation involves modifying
_multiple_ disk blocks.

[.slider]
.Example of creating a new file in an existing directory:
. Allocate an *inode*, mark the used inode bitmap.
. Allocate *data blocks*, mark the used data block bitmap.
. *Associate* data blocks with the file by modifying the inode.
. Add inode to the given *directory* by modifying the directory file.
. *Write* data blocks.
--

== How Caching Exacerbates Consistency

Observation: file system operations that modify multiple blocks may leave the
file system in an *inconsistent* state if partially completed.

[.slider]
.How does caching exacerbate this situation?
* May increase the time span between when the _first_ write of the
operation hits the disk and the _last_ is completed.

== What Can Go Wrong?

What kinds of inconsistency can take place if the system is interrupted
between the multiple operations necessary to complete a write?

. Allocate an *inode*, mark the used inode bitmap. [.slide]#*inode*
incorrectly marked in use.#
. Allocate *data blocks*, mark the used data block bitmap. [.slide]#Data
blocks incorrectly marked in use.#
. *Associate* data blocks with the file by modifying the inode.
[.slide]#Dangling file not present in any directory.#
. Add inode to the given *directory* by modifying the directory file.
. *Write* data blocks. [.slide]#Data loss!#

== Maintaining File System Consistency

[.slider]
.What's the safest approach?
* *Don't buffer writes!*
* We call this a _write through_ cache because writes do not hit the cache.

[.slider]
.What's the most dangerous approach?
* *Buffer all operations until blocks are evicted.*
* We call this a _write back_ cache.

[.slider]
.Which approach is better for
* performance?
* safety?

<<<

[.slider]
.What about a middle ground?
* Write important file system data metadata structures—superblock, inode
maps, bitmaps, etc.—immediately, but delay data writes.

[.slide]
--
File systems also give use processes some control through `sync` (sync
the entire file system) and `fsync` (sync one file).

== Next Time

Journaling, and then two very different file system designs:

* The Berkeley Fast File System (FFS)
* And log-structures file systems (LFS).
