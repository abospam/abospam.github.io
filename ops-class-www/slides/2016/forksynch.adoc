== Review: Levels of Indirection

[.slider]
* *Three* levels of indirection:
** file descriptor -> file handle.
** file handle -> file object.
** file object -> blocks on disk.

[.nooutline]
== Sharing File State

[.slider]
.The additional level of indirection allows certain pieces of state to be shared separately.
* *File descriptors* are private to each process.
* *File handles* are private to each process but shared after process
creation.
** *File handles* store the current file *offset*, or the position in
the file that the next read will come from or write will go to. File
handles can be *deliberately* shared between two processes.
* *File objects* hold other file state and can be shared *transparently*
between many processes.

== Review: `fork()`

[.slider]
. `fork()` copies one thread--the caller.
. `fork()` copies the address space.
. `fork()` copies the process file table.

== Questions About ``fork()``?

== Pipes

[.slider]
.Chains of communicating processes can be created by exploiting the `pipe()` system call.
* `pipe()` creates an anonymous pipe object and returns a two file
descriptors: one for the read-only end, and the other for the write-only
end.
* Anything written to the write-only end of the pipe is immediately
available at the read-only end of the pipe.
* Pipe contents are buffered in memory.
* *Why is this useful?*

== IPC Using `fork()` and `pipe()`

. Before calling `fork()` the parent creates a pipe object by calling
pipe().
. Next, it calls `fork()`.
. After `fork()` the parent closes its copy of the read-only end and the
child closes its copy of the write-only end.
. Now the parent can pass information to the child.

== Issues with `fork()`

[.slider]
.Copying all that state is expensive!
* Especially when the next thing that a process frequently does is
start load a new binary which destroys most of the state `fork()` has
carefully copied!

[.slider]
.Several solutions to this problem:
* *Optimize existing semantics*: through copy-on-write, a clever
memory-management optimization we will discuss in several weeks.
* *Change the semantics*: `vfork()`, which will fail if the child does anything other than
immediately load a new executable.
** Does not copy the address space!

== Issues with `fork()`

.What if I don't want to copy all of my process state?
[.slider]
* `fork()` is now replaced by `clone()`, a more flexible primitive that
enables more control:
** over sharing, including sharing memory, and signal handlers,
** and over child execution, which begins at a function pointer passed
to the system call instead of resuming at the point where `fork()` was
called.
* Try `man clone` in your CSE421 VM.

== The Tree of Life

[.slider]
* `fork()` establishes a parent-child relationship between two process at
the point when each one is created.
* The `pstree` utility allows you to visualize these relationships.

== Questions?

== Fast Forward: Synchronization

[.slider]
.What you need to know
* The OS creates the _illusion of concurrency_ by quickly switching the
processor(s) between multiple threads
** We will back up and discuss how this happens after discussion
synchronization
* *Threads* are used to abstract and multiplex the CPU

== Pandora's Concurrency Box

[.slider]
.The illusion of concurrency is both *powerful* and *useful*:
** It helps us think about how to structure our applications.
** It hides latencies caused by slow hardware devices.

[.slider]
.Unfortunately, concurrency also creates *problems*:
* *Coordination*: how do we enable efficient communication between the
multiple threads involved in performing a single task?
* *Correctness*: how do we ensure that shared state remains consistent
when being accessed by multiple threads concurrently? How do we enforce
time-based semantics?
* We will focus on *correctness* today but return to *coordination*
later.

== Patient 0

[.slider]
.The *operating system* itself is one of the most difficult concurrent programs to write. Why?
* It is multiplexing access to hardware resources and therefore sharing
a great deal of state between multiple processes!
* It frequently uses many threads to hide hardware delays while
servicing devices and application requests.
* *Lots of shared state* plus *lots of threads* equals a difficult
synchronization problem.
* Also, if the operating system gets synchronization wrong *bad things
happen*.

== Concurrency v. Parallelism

The https://golang.org/[Go developers] have a great description of this
distinction. http://blog.golang.org/concurrency-is-not-parallelism[According
to them]:

[.small]
--
[quote]
...when people hear the word concurrency they often think of parallelism, a
related but quite distinct concept. In programming, concurrency is the
composition of independently executing processes, while parallelism is the
simultaneous execution of (possibly related) computations. Concurrency is
about dealing with lots of things at once. Parallelism is about doing lots of
things at once.

== Unless Shown Otherwise...

Concurrency forces us to relax any assumptions that we may want to make about how any particular thread executes.

[.slider]
.Unless explicitly synchronized, threads may:
. Be run in *any order*,
. Be stopped and restarted at *any time*,
. Remain stopped for *arbitrary lengths of time*.

[.slider]
* Generally these are *good things*â€”the operating system is making
choices about how to allocate resources.
* When accessing shared data these are *challenges* that force us to
program more carefully.

== The Bank Example

Consider the following code snippet.

[source,c,linenums,role='smaller']
----
void giveGWATheMoolah(account_t account, int largeAmount) {
  int gwaHas = get_balance(account);
  gwaHas = gwaHas + largeAmount;
  put_balance(account, gwaHas);
  notifyGWAThatHeIsRich(gwaHas);
  return;
}
----

[.slider]
.Assume I have *$1,000* and that *two* of you are trying to make deposits concurrently:
* One of you is depositing *$1,000* (this person gets a B).
* One of you is depositing *$2,000* (A- material).

== Race Conditions

A *race condition* is "when the output of a process is unexpectedly
dependent on timing or other events."

[.slider]
.Note that the definition of a race depends on what we *expected* to happen:
* We expected me to have *$4,000* after both deposits. (Otherwise we
are not observing the Law of the Conversation of Money, probably
important to banks except during bailouts.)

* How to synchronize: what to protect, how to protect it.
* More more useful synchronization primitives: locks, semaphores.
* Being _too_ synchronized, i.e. *deadlock*.
