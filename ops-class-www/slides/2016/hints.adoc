== Performance and Benchmarking: Questions?

== Statistics: That's Math, Right

Computer systems researchers have a somewhat tortured relationship with
*statistics* and math. [.slide]#(Many of us are computer systems researchers
because we weren't smart enough to do mathematics.)#

[.slider]
* On a *good day*: [.slide]#"I'll rerun my experiment a few times and compute an
average."#
* For *extra-special bonus points*: [.slide]#"I'll put error bars on my
graph."#

== First, Predict

*Before* performing an experiment and collecting data it is helpful to make
predictions.

[.slider]
* One way to do this is to *draw* sketches of the graphs you expect to
produce.
* After collecting real results you can compare them against your
predictions as a way of developing intuition about your system.
* (Predictions about simple cases are also good ways to validate models
and simulators.)

== Understand Your Data

Beware the premature use of *summary statistics*--means, medians, etc.

[.slide]
--
As an example, the following data from two experiments could have the
*same* mean and median:

[cols="2*"]
|===

a|

a|
image:figures/bimodal.gif[width="50%"]

|===
--

[.slide]
--
Clearly they would have *very different* implications for performance
improvement, so _examine your raw data!_
--

== Love Your Outliers

[.slider]
.Outliers are special and deserve special treatment.
* They may just be *weird* remnants of your measurement harness.
* *They may have a lot more to tell you.*
* Understand them either way.

== Deciding What to Improve

Improve the *slowest* part, right?

[.slider]
* (Even if it _were_ this simple, getting programmers to work on any
one specific thing can be hard. Frequently they decide to optimize
something simply because "they want to".)

[.slider]
.Say your code has two functions:
. `foo` which takes 5 minutes to execute.
. `bar` which takes 5 seconds to execute.

[.slide]
--
Clearly you should immediately get to work improving `foo`, right?
--

== Why Not `foo`?

What two elements have we missed in our overly-simplistic decision?

[.slider]
. *Significance*: how much does `foo` matter?
. *Difficulty*: how hard is it going to be to improve `foo`?

[.slider]
.What do we likely know more about at this point after our experimentation?
* *Significance*, so let's start there.

== Amdahl's Law

[.small]
____
The impact of any effort to improve system performance is constrained by
the performance of the parts of the system *not targeted* by the
improvement.
____

[.slider]
.Imagine that have the choice between:
. Reducing the execution time of `foo` from + 5 minutes → 1 minute.
. Reducing the execution time of `bar` from + 5 seconds → 4 seconds.

[.slider]
.Note that the improvement to `foo` is better:
* _absolutely_ (4 minutes v. 1 second) and
* _proportionally_ (80% v. 20%).

foo

== Not So Fast (Pun Intended)

.Imagine that have the choice between:
. Reducing the execution time of `foo` from + 5 minutes → 1 minute.
. Reducing the execution time of `bar` from + 5 seconds → 4 seconds.

But what if our program spends *95%* of its time running `bar` but
only *0.1%* running `foo`?
[.slider]
* `foo` speedup: 0.001 * 240 seconds = *0.24 seconds*.
* `bar` speedup: 0.95 * 1 = *0.95 seconds*.

[.slide]

This is why server performance geeks take a *month vacation* every
time they trim _one instruction_ off of a hot path.
--

== Amdahl's Law

Even more colloquially:

____
Ignore the thing that *looks* the worst and fix the thing that is *doing
the most damage*.
____

[.slide]
--
And the unfortunate corollary to Amdahl's law:

____
The more you improve one part of a system the less likely it is that you
are still working on the right problem!
____

== Hints for Computer System Design

https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/acrobat-17.pdf["Hints
for Computer System Design"] by
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butler_Lampson[Butler Lampson].

== Systems Are More Complicated Than Algorithms

(Don't tell [.spelling_exception]#Atri#.)

[.slider]
.Why is designing a computer system different from designing an algorithm?
* "The external interface (that is, the requirement) is less precisely
defined, more complex, and more subject to change."
* "The system has much more internal structure, and hence many internal
interfaces."
* "The measure of success is much less clear."

[quote, "Butler Lampson", role='small']
____
I have designed and built a number of computer systems, some that worked and
some that didn’t. I have also used and studied many other systems, both
successful and unsuccessful. From this experience come some general hints for
designing successful systems. I claim no originality for them; most are part
of the folk wisdom of experienced designers. Nonetheless, even the expert
often forgets, and after the second system [6] comes the fourth one.
____

== Three Goals

[.slider]
.What are the three goals Lampson focuses on?
* Functionality
* Speed
* Fault-tolerance

[.slider]
.What are the three parts of the design task he identifies?
* Ensuring completeness
* Choosing interfaces
* Designing implementations
