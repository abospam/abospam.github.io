== Today

* Finish hardware interrupts.
* Software interrupts and exceptions.

[.nooutline]
== $ cat announce.txt

* I have good news and bad news...

[.nooutline]
== Good News: `test161`!

[.slider]
* `test161` has been released. Please follow the installation instructions on
Discourse.

* ...And it's awesome. Thanks to Scott and Yihong!

* `test161` submit should be done shortly. If needed, we'll push the
link:/asst/1/[ASST1] due date. (But don't plan on it.)

[.nooutline]
== Bad News

[.slider]
* It was brought to my attention that there was inappropriate material
presented in yesterday's recitation.

* As a result, if you would like partial credit on the assignment for the
parts that were revealed please contact the course staff.

* (Note that the "solutions" that were revealed were _not entirely correct_, so
please beware. We are preparing an update to the test cases to catch these
errors.)

* Note also that you need working locks and CVs for link:/asst/2/[ASST2] and
ASST3, so receiving credit will not solve that problem.

* Note that the video for yesterday's recitation will not be posted.

* Any questions?

== [.smaller]#Questions: Privileges, Interrupts, Exceptions?#

[.nooutline]
== Review: Operating System Privilege

[.slider]
.Why does the operating system need special privileges?
* *To divide resources* between multiple application and *enforce these
divisions*.

[.slider]
.True or false: implementing common operating system abstractions requires special privileges?
* *False.* [.spelling_exception]#Exokernels# provide a design point indicating that
implementing most of operating system abstractions in unprivileged
libraries is possible.

[.nooutline]
== Review: Operating Modes

[.slider]
.How does the processor provide the operating system with special privileges?
* Through *privileged* or *kernel* mode which allows the kernel to use
special instructions.

[.nooutline]
== Review: Interrupt Handling

[.slider]
.When an interrupt happens the CPU:
. Enters privileged mode,
. records state necessary to allow the operating system to process the
interrupt
. jumps to a fixed memory location and begins executing instructions.

[.nooutline]
== Review: Hardware Interrupts

Hardware interrupts occur when [.slide]*a device needs attention*.

[.slider]
.What are examples of hardware interrupts?
. A disk read completed.
. A network card received a packet.
. A timer fired.

[.nooutline]
== [.smaller]#Questions: Privileges, Interrupts, Exceptions?#

== Masking Interrupts

[.slider]
* Hardware interrupts can be either *asynchronous* or *synchronous*.
* Asynchronous interrupts can be *ignored* or masked.
** The processor provides an interrupt mask allowing the operating
system to choose which interrupts will trigger the ISR.
** If an interrupt is masked, it will not trigger the ISR.
** If an interrupt is still asserted when it is unmasked, it will
trigger the ISR at that point.
* Some interrupts are *synchronous* or not maskable: these typically
indicate very serious conditions which must be handled immediately.
** Example: processor reset.

== Why Mask Interrupts?

[.slider]
* Choosing to ignore interrupts allows the system to *prioritize*
certain interrupts over others.
** "_The DVD write buffer is empty_" is more important than "_There is a
network packet waiting to be processed._"
* In some cases handling certain interrupts generates other interrupts
which would prevent the system from handling the original interrupt!

== Protecting Interrupt Handlers

[.slider]
* What would happen if applications were allowed to modify the interrupt
service routines?
** Applications could take control of devices by preventing the kernel
from communicating with them. *Disaster!*
* Interrupt handlers allow the operating system to *control access* to
hardware devices and *protect them* from direct control by untrusted
applications.
* The memory that contains interrupt handlers is protected from access
by user applications.
* One of the *first things* that the kernel does on boot is install its
interrupt handlers!

== Software Interrupts

Given that the operating system prevents unprivileged code from
directly accessing system resources, *how do applications gain access to
these protected resources?*

[.slider]
* "Hey, over here, I need to read some data from disk!"
* "I could really use some more memory. Please?"

== `syscall`

[.slider]
* CPUs provide a *special instruction* (`syscall` on the MIPS) that
generates a software (or synthetic) interrupt.
* Software interrupts provide a mechanism for user code to indicate that
it needs help from the kernel.
* Rest of the interrupt handling path is unchanged. The CPU:
[.slider]
. *enters privileged mode*,
. *records state* necessary to process the interrupt,
. *jumps to a pre-determined memory location* and begins executing
instructions.

== Making System Calls

To access the kernel system call interface an application:

[.slider]
. arranges arguments to the system call in an agreed-on place where the
kernel can find them, typically in registers or on its stack,
. loads a number identifying the system call it wants the kernel to
perform into a pre-determined register, and
. executes the `syscall` instruction.

[.slider]
--
`libc` provides the wrappers around the `syscall` instruction that
programmers are familiar with.

*You can find this code in your OS/161 source tree. Look around!*
--

== Software Exceptions

An *software exception* indicates that code running on the CPU has
created a situation that the processor needs help to address.

[.slider]
.Can you think of examples of software exceptions?
* Divide by zero--probably kills the process.
* Attempt to use a privileged instruction--also probably kills the
process.
* Attempt to use a virtual address that the CPU does not know how to
translate--a common exception handled transparently as part of virtual
memory management.

== [.small]#Software Exceptions v. Software Interrupts#

[.slider]
.*Interrupts* are *voluntary*.
* Think of the CPU as saying to the kernel: "The `/bin/true` process
would like your assistance."

[.slider]
.*Exceptions* are *non-voluntary*.
* Think of the CPU as saying to the kernel: "I need some help with this
`/bin/false` process. It just tried to divide by zero and I think it needs
to be terminated."
