== Review: TLB v. Page Faults

[.slider]
.We distinguish between two kinds of memory-related fault:
* *TLB Fault:* a required virtual to physical address translation is
not in the TLB.
* *Page Fault:* the contents of a virtual page are either not
initialized or not in memory.

[.slider]
._Every_ page fault is preceded by a TLB fault.
* If the contents of the virtual page are not in memory, a translation
cannot exist for it!

[.slider]
._Not every_ TLB fault generates a page fault.
* If page is in memory and the translation is the page table, the TLB
fault can be handled without generating a page fault.

[.nooutline]
== Review: Swap Out

[.slider]
.To swap a page to disk we must:
. *Remove* the translation from the TLB, if it exists.
. *Copy* the contents of the page to disk.
. *Update* the page table entry to indicate that the page is on disk.

== Review: Swap In

[.slider]
.When *must* we swap in a page?
* When the virtual address is used by the process!

[.slider]
.To translate a virtual address used by a process that points to a page that has been swapped out, we must:
.  *Stop* the instruction that is trying to translate the address until
we can retrieve the contents.
.  *Allocate* a page in memory to hold the new page contents.
.  *Locate* the page on disk using the page table entry.
.  *Copy* the contents of the page from disk.
.  *Update* the page table entry to indicate that the page is in
memory.
.  *Load* the TLB.
.  *Restart* the instruction that was addressing the virtual address we
retrieved.

== Swapping: Questions?

[.small]
== Page Eviction

In order to swap _out_ a page we need to choose *which* page to move
to disk.

In order to swap _in_ a page we might need to choose which page to
swap out.

[.slider]
.Swapping cost-benefit calculation:
* *Cost*: [.slide]#mainly the *time* and disk *bandwidth* required to move a
page to and from disk.#
* *Benefit*: [.slide]#the use of 4K (or a page) of memory as long as the page on disk
remains unused.#

[.slide]
--
There are tricks that the operating might play to *minimize* the cost,
but mainly we will focus on algorithms designed to *maximize* the
benefit.

(Another complementary description of our goal is *minimizing* the *page
fault rate*.)
--

== Page Eviction FAIL: Thrashing

[quote,Wikipedia,role='small']
____
Thrashing is a colloquialism normally used to describe a computer whose
virtual memory subsystem is in a constant state of paging, rapidly
exchanging data in memory for data on disk, to the exclusion of most
application-level processing. This causes the performance of the
computer to degrade or collapse.
____

== Maximizing Benefit

*Benefit*: the use of 4K of memory as long as the page on disk remains unused.

[.slider]
.How do we *maximize* the benefit?
* Pick the page to evict that will remain unused *the longest*!

== The Best Bet

[.slider]
.What is the absolute best page to evict, the one that page replacement algorithms _dream_ about?
* A page that will *never be used again*!

== Break Out the Ball

Think back to scheduling algorithms. (This is a bit simpler.)

[.slider]
.What would we like to know about a page when choosing one to evict?
* *How long* will it be before this page is used again?

[.slide]
--
The *optimal scheduler* evicts the page that will remain unused the
longest. This clearly maximizes our swapping cost-benefit calculation.
[.slider]
* This scheduler is *difficult to implement*!
--

== What Now?

When we can't predict the future, we... [.slide]*use the past to predict the
future!*

== The Past Didn't Go Anywhere

[.slider]
.Intelligent page replacement requires three things:
. determining *what* information to track,
. figuring out how to *collect* that information, and
. how to *store* it.

== There Be Tradeoffs

[.slider]
* Collecting statistics may be *expensive*, slowing down the process of
translating virtual addresses.
* Storing statistics may be *expensive*, occupying kernel memory that
could be better used for other things.

== Simplest

[.slider]
.What is the simplest possible page replacement algorithm?
* *Random*.

[.slider]
.Pros:
* Extremely simple.
* Good baseline for algorithms that try to be smarter.

[.slider]
.Cons:
* Too simple. We can probably do better.

== Use The Past, Luke

[.slider]
.What is an algorithm that *uses a page's past to predict its future*?
* *Least Recently Used (LRU)*:
* Choose the page that has not been used for the longest period of time.
* Hopefully this is a page that will not be used *again* for a while.

[.slider]
.Pros:
* Might be as good as we can do without predicting the future.

[.slider]
.Cons:
* How do we *tell* how long it has been since a page has been accessed?
* How do we *store* how long it has been since a page has been accessed?

== LRU: Collecting Statistics

[.slider]
.At what point does the operating system *know* that a process has accessed a virtual page?
* When we load the entry into the TLB!

[.slider]
.Does this reflect every virtual page access?
* *No!* Only the first. A page that is accessed once and one that is
accessed 1,000 times are _indistinguishable_.

[.slider]
.Why not record every page access?
* *Too slow!*

== LRU: Storing Statistics

[.slider]
.How much access time information can we store?
* 32 bits = 2^32^ "ticks", but *doubles* the page table entry size!
* 8 bits = 256 "ticks".

[.slider]
.How do we find the least recently used page?
* Need some kind of *efficient data structure* holding all physical
pages on the system that is searched on every page eviction.

== Clock LRU

[.slider]
* *Simple* and *efficient* LRU-_like_ algorithm.
* *One bit* of accessed information, set when loading a virtual address
into the TLB.

[.slider]
.To locate a page to evict:
.  Cycle through all pages in memory in a fixed order.
.  If a page accessed bit is *clear*, evict that page.
.  If a page accessed bit is *set*, clear the bit.

== Clock Speed

[.slider]
.What does it mean when the clock hand is turning *slowly?*
* Little memory pressure, or
* We are making good decisions about what to evict.

[.slider]
.What does it mean when the clock hand is turning *rapidly?*
* Lots of memory pressure, or
* We are making bad decisions about what to evict.

[.nooutline]
== Page Replacement: Questions?

== Memory Management Design Exercise: Copy-on-Write

Remember the problem with `fork`?

[.slider]
* Have to copy the entire address space of the parent!
* If the parent has N pages allocated, we have to find *N more free
pages!*
[.slider]
** ...and then the child calls exec anyway.

[.slide]
--
Can we avoid this?
--

== Copy-on-Write

[.small]
--
Goal: don't allocate *any* additional memory during fork, but preserve
private address spaces.

[.slider]
.Here's what to do:
. During fork, point all child's PTEs to the *same* physical memory as
the parent.
. As long as the child and parent are both just reading from any
shared page, we are OK.
** Large parts of the address space may be read-only or
read-mostly anyway...
. As soon as either the child or the parent modifies the contents of
any shared virtual page, [.slide]*we have to make a private copy.*
. How do we trap writes? [.slide]#Mark the page as *read only* in the TLB!#
