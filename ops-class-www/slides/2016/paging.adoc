== Today

* Locating page state.

[.nooutline]
== $ cat announce.txt

[.slider]
* Midterm will cover everything through today.
* Jinghao will lead a midterm review in recitation tomorrow.
* No recitation Friday.
* I'll record a midterm review screencast so that we can continue Friday.

[.nooutline]
== Midterm

[.slider]
* 50 minutes, 50 points. Scaled to 15% of your final grade.
* Same format as previous years:
** 10 1-point multiple choice
** 6 choose 4 5-point short answer
** 2 choose 1 20-point long answer.
* Same approach as the pre-term: assigned seats, seating chart distributed
1-hour before, etc. *Please be on time.* We will end promptly at 2:50PM.
* **There is no makeup exam.** If you are not here and not in the hospital,
you will receive a 0.

<<<

* 2016 wrinkle:
** _most_ of the multiple choice will similar to previous years
** _at least 2__ of the short answer will be from previous years
** one of the long answer _may_ be from a previous year

[.nooutline]
== ASST2/ASST3 Late Credit

[.slider]
* ASST2:
** You can still submit (25 point penalty)
** You can request the solution set (50 point penalty). If you do so, you
will automatically receive your original ASST2 score.
* ASST3 deal:
** ASST3 is broken into three 100-point parts due at two-week intervals,
starting Friday.
** Late submission for the first two checkpoints will result in 10 point
deductions.
** Late submission for the final checkpoint will result in no credit.

== Locating Page State

[.slider]
* _Process:_ "Machine! Store to address `0x10000`!"
* _MMU:_ "Where the heck is virtual address `0x10000` supposed to map to?
Kernel...help!"
* (Exception.)
* _Kernel_: Let's see... where did I put that page table entry for
`0x10000`... just give me a minute... I know it's around here somewhere...
I really should be more organized!

[.slider]
.What are the requirements for how we locate page information?
* *Speed*: translation is a _hot path_ and should be as efficient as
possible.
* *Compactness*: data structures we use should not take up too much
physical memory.

== Page Tables

The data structure used to quickly map a *virtual page number* to a *page
table entry* is called a *page table*.

[.slider]
* Each process has a _separate_ page table.
* *Why?* [.slide]#Virtual addresses are private to each process and
translated differently for each.#

== Flat Page Tables

*Approach*: use one array to hold all page table entries for each process.
Virtual page number is index into this array.

== Flat Page Tables

* *Approach*: use one array to hold all page table entries for each
process. Virtual page number is index into this array.

[.slider]
* *Speed*: O(1). VPN is used directly as an index into the array.
* *Compactness*: *4 MB* per process that may have to be *contiguous*!
Most is *unused*!

image:figures/memory/flatpagetable-7.svg[width="50%"]

== Linked List Page Tables

[.slider]
* *Approach*: list of PTEs for each process, searched on each
translation.

== Linked List Page Tables

*Approach*: list of PTEs for each process, searched on each
translation.

[.slider]
* *Speed*: O(n) for n valid virtual pages.
* *Compactness*: *4 bytes * n* for n valid virtual pages. All entries
are used!

== [.spelling_exception]#An Early ASST3 K.I.S.S.:#

Don't feel like you have to do something overly complicated for ASST3!
First get it right, then optimize.

== Multi-Level Page Tables

*Approach*: build a tree-like data structure mapping VPN to PTE. Break
VPN into multiple parts, each used as an index at a separate level of
the tree.

[.slider]
* Example: with 4K pages VPN is *20* bits. Use *top 10* bits as index
into *top-level* page table, *bottom 10 bits* as index into second-level
page table.
** Each page table is 2^10^ * 4 bytes = 4K. Convenient!

== Multi-Level Page Tables

Build a tree-like data structure mapping VPN to PTE. Break VPN into multiple
parts, each used as an index at a separate level of the tree.

[.slider]
* *Speed*: O(c). Constant number of look ups per translation depending on
tree depth.
* *Compactness*: Depends on sparsity of address space, but better than
flat and worse than linked list.

== Out of Core

So far we have been talking about cases where processes are able to use
the physical memory available on the machine.

But what happens when we *run out*?

== Out of Core

When we *run out*, there are two options:
[.slider]
. *Fail*, and either don't load the process (`exec()`), don't create a
new process (`fork()`), refuse to allocate more heap (`sbrk()`), or kill the
process if it is trying to allocate more stack.

. *Create more space*, preserving the contents of memory for later use.

== Virtually Sneaky

Virtual address translation gives the kernel the ability to remove
memory from a process *behind its back*.

[.slider]
.What are the requirements for doing this?
* The _last time_ the process used the virtual address, it behaved like
memory.
* The _next time_ the process uses the virtual address, it behaves like
memory.
* In between, whatever data was stored at that address must be
*preserved*.

[.nooutline]
== Next Time

[.slider]
* Swapping. How do we remove a page?
* Page replacement algorithms. How do we choose a page to remove?
