== How To Read A Research Paper

[.slider]
. Don't be afraid: *you're ready!*
. Read good papers from the top conferences
. _Skim_ to get the big picture, _read_ for the details.
** Most systems papers have one or two big ideas and a lot of implementation.
. Understand the _places where papers get published_
. Understand the _kinds of papers_
. Understand the _parts of a paper_

[.small.spelling_exception]
== Places Where Papers Get Published

[.slider]
. *Workshop papers*: _short_ (5-6 pages), usually containing only a
provocative argument, system design, or very preliminary results.
** Example:
http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/margo/papers/hotos09/paper.pdf[Hierarchical
Filesystems Are Dead], by Margo Seltzer and Nicholas Murphy. Published at
https://www.usenix.org/conferences/byname/155[HotOS], a workshop on hot
topics in operating systems.

. *Conference papers*: _long_ (12-14 pages), enough space to describe and
evaluate a complete novel system.
** Example: http://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/commutativity:sosp13.pdf[The
Scalable Commutativity Rule], by Austin Clements, M. Frans Kaashoek, Nickolai
Zeldovich, Robert Morris and Eddie Kohler. Published at
http://sosp.org/[SOSP], the top conference on computer systems.

. *Journal papers*: _longer_ (than conference papers), usually a published
conference paper with extra material (frequently all of the unneccesary
results that they removed to make the conference page limit).
** My advice: read the conference paper.

[.smaller]
== Kinds of Papers

Clearly this is an incomplete list, but identifying the kind of paper can
help you read it and understand its contributions.

[.slider]
. *(Big) idea papers*: presents a _new approach_ to an existing problem or a new
idea about how to build systems. Should convince you that the solution is (1)
new, (2) works, and (3) is useful.
. *Problem papers*: presents a _new problem_ and, usually, some ideas about
how to solve it. Should convince you that the problem is (1), (2) matters and
(3) that there are some ways to solve it.
. *Data papers*: present _novel analysis_ or _analysis of a novel data set_ that
produces interesting insights. Should convince you that the results are
useful to the design of future systems.
. *New technology papers*: describe some new hardware capability or device
feature and why it's interesting. Should convince you that the hardware can
be used to build better systems.
. *Wrong way papers*: argue that the community is solving an _existing
problem incorrectly_. Frequently these are workshop-length papers and
eventually lead to idea papers. Should be able to convince you that everyone
else is confused and misguided. (Good luck!)

== Parts of a Research Paper

Not all of these are included in every paper, and they are not always called
the same thing. Many variants exist but these are the common elements.

[.slider]
.The "why you should read this paper" parts:
. *Abstract*: an overview of the paper and its contribution. Great place to
get the _big picture_.
. *Introduction*: an extension of the abstract. Usually contains:
[.slider]
** A problem and solution statement (if appropriate)
** Persuasive arguments to keep you reading
** A preview of the interesting results ahead
** Navigational information to guide you through the rest of the paper
. *Motivation*:
** More arguments about why this is a problem, why people have been solving
this problem the wrong way, or why this data is interesting--depending on the
type of paper.

.The "what we did" parts:
. *Design*: presents the design of the system, usually at as high a level as
possible.
. *Implementation*: presents details of the implementation and any
interesting implementation challenges.
. *Related work*: put the work in context by comparing it to other systems.
Important to establish _novelty_.
. *Results*: for data analysis papers, most of the paper is spent analyzing
the data set that was collected and evaluated. This usually replaces an
typical evaluation since there may not be a new idea.

[.slider]
.The "did it work" part:
. *Evaluation*: measures things about the prototype system intended to
demonstrate that it works.

== Questions About Approaching A Research Paper?

== Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks

[.slider]
.What kind of paper is this?
* *Big idea* paper!
* Spawned a commonly-used technology, an entire industry, and lots of similar
approaches.

[.slider]
.What is the big idea? (Hint: it has nothing to do with disks...)
* Several cheap things can be better than one expensive thing!

[.slider]
.Where else do we see this idea applied today?
* Multicore processors.
* Google.
* Crowdsourcing.

[.small]
== RAID: Problems

[.slider]
.What is the problem that the RAID paper identifies?
* Computer CPUs are getting faster...
* Computer memory is getting faster...
* Hard drives are not keeping up!

[.slide]
____
While we can imagine improvements in software file systems via buffering for
near term I/O demands, we need innovation to avoid an I/O crisis.
____

[.slider]
.What is the problem with the RAID solution?
* Many cheap things fail much more frequently than one expensive thing.
* So need a plan to handle failures.

== RAID 1

image::http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b7/RAID_1.svg[height="200"]

.RAID 1 (Mirroring)
* Two duplicate disks.
* Writes must go to both disks, reads can
come from either.

[.slider]
* Performance: [.slide]*better for reads.*
* Capacity: [.slide]*unchanged!*

[.small]
== RAID 2

image::http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/b5/RAID2_arch.svg[height="200"]

.RAID 2
* *Byte-level striping*, single error disk.
* *Hamming codes* to detect failures and correct errors.
* Most reads and writes require all disks.

[.slider]
* Capacity: [.slide]*improved.*

[.small]
== RAID 3

image::http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/RAID_3.svg[height="200"]

.RAID 3
* *Only correct errors* since disks can detect when they fail.
* Byte-level striping, single *parity* disk.
* Most reads and writes require all disks.

[.slider]
* Capacity: [.slide]*improved.*

[.small]
== RAID 4

image::http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/RAID_4.svg[height="200"]

.RAID 4
* *Block-level striping*, single parity disk.
* Better distribution of reads between disks due to larger stripe size,
* but all writes all must access the parity disk.

[.slider]
* Performance: [.slide]*improved for reads.*

[.small]
== RAID 5 (Full Victory)

image::http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/64/RAID_5.svg[height="200"]

.RAID 5
* Block-level striping
* *Multiple parity disks*.
* Better distribution of writes between disks.

[.slider]
* Performance: [.slide]*improved for writes.*

== RAID 0 (Non-RAID)

.RAID 0
* Each disk stores half of the data.
* No error correction or redundancy.

[.slider]
* Performance: [.slide]*fantastic!*
* Capacity: [.slide]*fantastic!*
* Redundancy: [.slide]*ZERO!*

== RAID: Redundancy

[.slider]
* RAID arrays can tolerate the failure of one (or more) disks.
* Once a (or several) fail, the array is vulnerable to data loss.
* An administrator must replace the disk(s) and then rebuild the array.

== RAID: Questions?

[.nooutline]
== Next Time

* Full virtualization.
