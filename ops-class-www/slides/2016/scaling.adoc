== Paper Overview

[.slider]
.What kind of paper is this?
* Benchmarking and analysis paper. (A kind we did not previously discuss...)
* But also kind of a _big idea_ paper.

[.slider]
.What's the big idea?
* People (including the authors) have been proposing that traditional OS designs would not scale to
many-core machines.
* Is this true?

<<<

[.small.spelling_exception]
____
There is a sense in the community that traditional kernel
designs wonâ€™t scale well on multicore processors: that
applications will spend an increasing fraction of their time
in the kernel as the number of cores increases. Prominent
researchers have advocated rethinking operating systems and new kernel designs intended to allow
scalability have been proposed (e.g., Barrelfish,
Corey, and fos). *This paper asks whether traditional
kernel designs can be used and implemented in a
way that allows applications to scale.*
____

[.small.slide]
____
This question is difficult to answer conclusively, but we attempt to shed a
small amount of light on it.
____

== What's The Approach?

[.slider]
.What is the approach taken in the paper?
* Benchmark Linux using applications that should scale well.
* Identify and fix scalability bottlenecks.
* Repeat.

<<<

[.small.spelling_exception]
____
*First* we measure scalability of the MOSBENCH applications on a recent Linux
kernel (2.6.35-rc5, released July 12, 2010) with 48 cores, using the
in-memory tmpfs file system to avoid disk bottlenecks. gmake scales well, but
the other applications scale poorly, performing much less work per core with
48 cores than with one core.
____

<<<

[.small]
____
We attempt to understand and fix the scalability problems, by modifying
either the applications or the Linux kernel.
____

<<<

[.small]
____
We then iterate, since fixing one scalability problem usually exposes further
ones.
____

<<<

[.small]
____
The end result for each application is either good scalability on 48 cores,
or attribution of non-scalability to a hard-to-fix problem with the
application, the Linux kernel, or the underlying hardware.
____

[.small]
____
The analysis of whether the kernel design is compatible with scaling rests on
the extent to which our changes to the Linux kernel turn out to be modest,
and the extent to which hard-to-fix problems with the Linux kernel ultimately
limit application scalability.
____

== What's The Result?

[.small.slide]
____
Our final contribution is an analysis using MOSBENCH that suggests that there
is *no immediate scalability reason to give up on traditional kernel designs*.
____

[.small]
== What is MOSBENCH?

[.slider.spelling_exception]
.What applications are included in MOSBENCH?
* A mail server (`exim`), using multiple processes to process incoming mail
concurrently.
* An in-memory key-value store object cache (`memcached`), using multiple
servers to handle multiple connections in parallel. (Already working around
an internal bottleneck.)
* A web server (`apache`) using one process per core.
* A database server (`postgres`), which starts one process per connection.
* A parallel build (`gmake`) building Linux using multiple cores.
* A file indexer (`psearchy').
* A map-reduce library (`metis`).

[.slider]
.Are these good benchmarks?
* The goal is to identify _kernel_ bottlenecks.

[.slider]
.What's a sign of bad kernel scalability?
* Spending more time in the kernel as the number of cores rises.

== (Aside) Why Does `gmake` Scale Well?

All the benchmarks scale poorly to multiple cores...except `gmake`.

.Why?
[.slider]
* Because kernel developers use it all the time!

[.slide.small]
____
`gmake` is the unofficial default benchmark in the Linux community since all
developers use it to build the Linux kernel. Indeed, many Linux patches
include comments like "This speeds up compiling the kernel."
____

== The Problems

____
Here are a few types of serializing interactions that the MOSBENCH
applications encountered. These are all classic considerations in parallel
programming...
____

<<<
____
1) The tasks may *lock a shared data structure*, so that increasing the
number of cores increases the lock wait time.
____

<<<
____
2) The tasks may *write a shared memory location*, so that increasing the
number of cores increases the time spent waiting for the cache coherence
protocol to fetch the cache line in exclusive mode. This problem can occur
even in lock-free shared data structures.
____

<<<
____
The tasks may *compete for space in a limited-size shared hardware cache*, so
that increasing the number of cores increases the cache miss rate. This
problem can occur even if tasks never share memory.
____

<<<
____
The tasks may *compete for other shared hardware resources* such as
inter-core interconnect or DRAM interfaces, so that additional cores spend
their time waiting for those resources rather than computing.
____

<<<
____
There may be *too few tasks to keep all cores busy*, so that increasing the
number of cores leads to more idle cores.
____
