== Today

* Scheduling goals.
* Human-computer expectations:
** Responsiveness
** Continuity
** Throughput
* Simple scheduling algorithms.

== Thread States

[.slider]
.We talk about threads—and sometimes the processes containing them—as being in several different states:
* *Running:* executing instructions on a CPU core.
* *Ready:* not executing instructions but capable of being restarted.
* *Waiting, Blocked or Sleeping:* not executing instructions and not
able to be restarted until some event occurs.

== Thread State Transitions

[.slider]
* Running → Ready: [.slide]#a thread was *descheduled*.#
* Running → Waiting: [.slide]#a thread performed a *blocking system call*.#
* Waiting → Ready: [.slide]#the event the thread was waiting for happened.#
* Ready → Running: [.slide]#a thread was *scheduled*.#
* Running → Terminated: [.slide]#a thread *exited* or hit a fatal
*exception*.#

Operating systems have data structures to organize threads into these
groups which you encountered during ASST1.

== Scheduling: What?

[.slider]
.What is scheduling?
* *Scheduling* is the process of choosing the next thread (or threads)
to run on the CPU (or CPUs).
* We will primarily discuss *single core* scheduling for most of the
week but return to multi-core scheduling issues later.

== Scheduling: Why?

[.slider]
.Why schedule threads?
* *CPU multiplexing*: we have more threads that cores to run them on.
* *Kernel privilege*: we are in charge of allocating the CPU and must
try to make good decisions. *Applications rely on it.*

== Scheduling: When?

[.slider]
.When does scheduling happen?
. When a thread *voluntarily* gives up the CPU by calling yield().
. When a thread makes a blocking *system call* and must sleep until
the call completes.
. When a thread *exits*.
. When the *kernel decides* that a thread has run for long enough.

[.slider]
* *#4* is what makes a scheduling policy *preemptive*, as opposed to
*cooperative*: the kernel can preempt (or stop) a thread that has not
requested to be stopped.

== Why `yield()`?

[.slider]
* We have not discussed yield().

[.slider]
.What is the rationale behind having a way for threads to voluntarily give up the CPU?
* `yield()` can be a useful way of allowing a well-behaved thread to tell
the CPU that it has no more useful work to do.
* `yield()` is inherently cooperative. "Let me get out of the way so that
another, more useful, thread can run."

== Scheduling: How?

[.slider]
.Two separate questions here:
* *Mechanism:* how do we switch between threads?
* *Policy:* how do we choose the next thread to run?

[.slider]
.How do we *switch between threads*?
* Perform a *context switch* and move threads between the *ready*,
*running*, and *waiting* queues.

[.slider]
.How do we *choose the next thread to run*
* Nice of you to ask. That's our focus this week.

== Policy v. Mechanism

[.slider]
.Scheduling is as example of useful separation between *policy* and *mechanism*:
* [.slide]*P*: deciding what thread to run.
* [.slide]*M*: context switch.
* [.slide]*M*: maintaining the running, ready and waiting queues.
* [.slide]*P*: giving preference to interactive tasks.
* [.slide]*M*: using timer interrupts to stop running threads.
* [.slide]*P*: choosing a thread to run at random.

== Scheduling Matters

How the CPU is scheduled impacts *every other part* of the system.
[.slider]
.Why?
* Using other system resources requires the CPU!

[.slider]
* *Intelligent scheduling* makes a modestly-powered system seem fast and responsive.
* *Stupid scheduling* makes a powerful system seem sluggish and laggy.

== Human-Computer Interaction (and Expectations)

[.slider]
.What do you expect from your machine?
* *Respond* (Click)
* *Continue* (Watch, or active waiting)
* *Finish* (Expect, or passive waiting)

== Respond (Click)

*Responsiveness*: when you give the computer and instruction, or input, it
*responds in a timely manner*.

[.slider]
* It may not *finish*, but at least you know it has *started* (or
understood).

[.slider]
--
Most of what we do with computers consists of responsive tasks. This
is *using* a computer, and what makes computers different from
television.
--

[.slider]
.Examples of responsive tasks:
* Web browsing: when a link is clicked, retrieve the web page.
* Editing: when I enter text at the keyboard, place it at the cursor.
* Chatting: when I hit send, transmit the text to my chat partner.

== Continue (Watch)

*Continuity*: when you ask the computer to perform a continuous task it does so smoothly.

[.slider]
* Continuity implies *active waiting*: you are not interacting with the
computer, but you are expecting it to continue to perform a task you
have initiated.

[.slider]
--
As computers have started to deliver media, this function is
*increasingly important*.
--

[.slider]
.Examples of continuous tasks:
* Blinking a cursor.
* Playing music or a movie.
* Stupid (!) web animations.

== Finish (Expect)

*Completion*: when we ask to the computer to perform a task—or it
performs one on our behalf—that we expect to take a long time, we want
it to complete eventually.

[.slider]
* Completion implies *passive waiting*: you are asking the computer to
continue to deliver interactive performance while working on your
long-running task. (We also consider these *background* tasks.)
* Unlike responsive and continuous task, background tasks may *not be
user initiated.*

[.slider]
.Examples of background tasks:
* Performing a system backup.
* Indexing files on my computer.

== Click, Watch, Expect

Many applications *combine* all three system expectations.

[.slider]
.Music player:
* *Click*: [.slide]#change tracks.#
* *Watch*: [.slide]#play the selected track.#
* *Finish*: [.slide]#update album artwork.#

[.slider]
.Web browser:
* *Click*: [.slide]#follow a link.#
* *Watch*: [.slide]#play web video.#
* *Finish*: [.slide]#index search history.#

[.small]
== Conflicting Goals

Scheduling is a balance between *meeting deadlines* and *optimizing
resource allocation*:

[.slider]
* Optimal resource allocation: carefully allocate tasks so that all
resources are constantly in used.
* Meeting deadlines: drop everything and do this *now*!

[.slide]
--
Responsiveness and continuity require meeting deadlines—unpredictable or
predictable:
--

[.slider]
* *Responsiveness* → unpredictable deadlines. "When the user moves the
mouse I need to be ready to redraw the cursor."
* *Continuity* → predictable deadlines. "Every 5 ms I need to write more
data to the sound card buffer."

[.slide]
--
Throughput requires careful resource allocation:
--

[.slider]
* *Throughput* → optimal resource allocation. "I should really give the
backup process more resources so that it can finish overnight."

== Deadlines Win

[.slider]
.Humans are sensitive to *responsiveness* and *continuity*.
* We don't notice resource allocation (as much).

[.slider]
* *Heard:* [.slide]#"My computer feels slow."#
* *Unheard:* [.slide]#"My computer is not using all of its RAM."#

[.slider]
.*Why*
* Poor responsiveness or continuity wastes *our time*! ("The mouse
jumped all over and I couldn't click anywhere.", "The movie kept
stalling and I couldn't watch it.")
* Poor throughput usually just wastes computer time. ("The backup took
12 hours but I was sleeping.")

== Scheduling Goals

(Or, *how to evaluate schedulers*.)

[.slider]
* How well does it meet deadlines—unpredictable or predictable?
* How completely does it allocate system resources?
** No point having idle CPU, memory, or disk bandwidth when something
useful could be happening.

[.slider]
.On human-facing systems, deadlines (or *interactivity*) usually wins. Why?
* Your time is more valuable than your computer's.

== (Aside) Realtime Scheduling

We have established that deadlines are important to human-facing
systems. This is mainly because systems that don't meet deadlines are
*annoying*. ("Buffering...", "Buffering...", etc.)

[.slider]
.There are other classes of systems where the failure to meet deadlines can be *fatal*.
* "I meant to get around to running the motion_stop task 1 s ago, but I
didn't quite make it. And...[.slied]#the robot rolled off of the cliff.#

== Scheduling Principles: Questions?

== Next Time

* Simple scheduling algorithms.
