I could not take it anymore so I counted the number of times this guy says
"right" from 19:00 to 24:00...  53 "rights" in 5 minutes. That is a "right"
for every 5.6 seconds! AAAAARGH!!!!

== Oracular Spectacular

[.slider]
.Normally we *cannot predict the future*
* Control flow is unpredictable.
* Users are unpredictable.

[.slider]
.Instead, *use the past to predict the future*.
* What did the thread do recently? It will probably keep doing that.

== Multi-Level Feedback Queues

[.slider]
* Choose a *scheduling quantum*. This is the maximum amount of time any
thread will be able to run at one time.
* Establish some number of queues; each represents a *level*.
* Threads from the highest-level queues are chosen first.
* Then:
[.slider]
..  Choose and run a thread from the highest-level non-empty queue.
..  If the thread *blocks* or *yields*, promote it to a higher level
queue.
..  If the thread must be *preempted* at the end of a quantum, demote it
to a lower level queue.

== Multi-Level Feedback Queues

[.slider]
.What happens to:
* CPU-bound threads? They descend to the depths.
* I/O-bound threads? They rise to the heights!

[.slider]
.Can anyone spot any problems with this approach?
* *Starvation!* Threads trapped in the lower queues may never have a
chance to run.

[.slide]
--
One solution is to periodically *rebalance* the levels by periodically
tossing everyone back to the top level. [.slide]#(Seems like kind of a
hack.)#
--

== Establishing Priorities

*Priorities* are a scheduling *abstraction* that allows the user, or
the system itself, to assign relative important to different tasks on
the system.

[.slider]
* Backup task: low priority.
* Video encoding: low priority.
* Video playback: high priority.
* Interactive applications: medium priority.

[.slide]
--
Priorities are always *relative*, and so host to a variety of
different problems.
--

== Priority Starvation

Strict priorities can lead to starvation when low-priority threads are
constantly blocked by high-priority threads with work to do.

[.slider]
.One solution: *lottery* scheduling:
. Give each thread a number of *tickets* proportional to their
*priority*.
. Choose a ticket at random. The thread holding the ticket gets to
run.

[.slide]
--
Priorities may also be used to determine *how long* threads are
allowed to run, i.e. dynamically adjusting their time quantum.

== Scheduling Algorithms: Questions?

== The Semi-Recent Recent History of the Linux Scheduler

The recent evolution of the Linux scheduler provides a fascinating view into:

* the difficulties in supporting a huge and growing number of hardware
platforms. (Servers, desktops, Android, embedded devices, etc.)
* the tensions that arise in collaborative development.
* the difficulties is steering large software projects fueled by
volunteers.
* the challenges of interactive benchmarking.
* incredibly contributions made by hackers with day jobs.

== Linux By The Numbers

[.slider]
* *9.2 million* lines of code. (55% device drivers.)
* *2,400* developers.
* New kernel every *2.75* months.

== Linux Development Process

*Big caveat*: I am not speaking from experience!

[.slider]
* Each file has a maintainer.
* Each subsystem has a maintainer.
* And then there's Linus/Andrew.

|===

== Kernel Development

[.slider]
* Linus, Andrew, and others maintain the *mainline* Linux kernel tree
used to generate official releases.
* Other developers may maintain their own trees to experiment with new
features. Some code will eventually move into the mainline, other things
may not.
* (Git was built to facilitate this working model. And to not suck.)

== Desktop v. Server

Just one example of tensions in a large community that now supports
many devices.

[.slider]
.Server Linux:
* *Well-defined* goals and well-established benchmarks.
* *Corporate* clients, many who pay for support.
* *Regular contact* with the Linux community.

[.slider]
.Desktop Linux:
* *Poorly-defined* goals, a scarcity of good benchmarks, and few people
savvy enough to run them.
* Users *too cheap* to buy Windows.
* Development? *What's that?*

== The Linux Kernel Mailing List

[.slider]
* I tried reading it once. *I had no idea what was going on 99% of the
time.*
* This is an intimidating place to go for "help", and you probably won't
get it.

== The Linux Kernel Mailing List

And, it's sometimes a male-dominated mean environment:

[quote, Sarah Sharp,role='small']
____
Seriously, guys?  Is this what we need in order to get improve -stable?
Linus Torvalds is advocating for physical intimidation and violence.
Ingo Molnar and Linus are advocating for verbal abuse.

Not *fucking* cool.  Violence, whether it be physical intimidation,
verbal threats or verbal abuse is not acceptable.  Keep it professional
on the mailing lists.

Let's discuss this at Kernel Summit where we can at least yell at each
other in person.  Yeah, just try yelling at me about this.  I'll roar
right back, louder, for all the people who lose their voice when they
get yelled at by top maintainers.  I won't be the nice girl anymore.
____

== Linux Scheduling Pre-2.6

[.slider]
* Pre-2.6 Linux systems used a scheduler that scaled poorly, requiring
O(n) time to schedule tasks where n is the number of runnable threads.
* The Linux 2.6 scheduler aimed to fix this.

== The Linux 2.6 O(1) Scheduler

[.slider]
* For Linux 2.6, Ingo Molnar, the Linux kernel scheduler maintainer,
implemented a new O(1) scheduler to address the scalability problems
inherent to the earlier approach.
* The O(1) scheduler combines a *static* and *dynamic* priority.
** Static priority: set by the user or system using nice.
** Dynamic priority: a potential "boost" to the static priority intended
to reward interactive threads.

== Problems With The O(1) Scheduler

[.slider]
* The *interactivity* boost code got very complex and difficult to
understand. It was not clear that it was doing the right thing.
* Not surprisingly, the scheduler was also difficult to model, useful in
order to convince yourself that it is doing "the right thing."

== Enter Con Kolivas

[.slider]
* An *Australian anaesthetist* turned Linux kernel programmer.
* Con became interested in scheduling, and in particular scheduling for
interactive workloads and systems.

== Interactivity, what is it?

[quote, Con Kolivas,role='smaller spelling_exception']
____
There has been a lot of talk about what makes up a nice feeling desktop
under linux. It comes down to two different but intimately related
parameters which are not well defined. We often use the terms
responsiveness and interactivity in the same sentence, but I'd like to
separate the two. As there is no formal definition I prefer to define
them as such:

*Responsiveness*: The rate at which your workloads can proceed under
different load conditions.

*Interactivity*: The scheduling latency and jitter present in tasks where
the user would notice a palpable deterioration under different load
conditions.

Responsiveness would allow you to continue using your machine without
too much interruption to your work, whereas interactivity would allow
you to play audio or video without any dropouts, or drag a gui window
across the screen and have it render smoothly across the screen without
jerks.
____

== 2004: Kolivas Releases The Rotating Staircase Scheduler

[.slider]
* Removes 498 lines of "black magic" aimed at improving interactivity
and replaces them with 200 lines of new code implementing a simple,
rank-based approach.
* Some similarities to MLFQ.

== 2007: Kolivas Releases The Rotating Staircase Deadline Scheduler

[.slider]

[quote, Con Kolivas, role='small spelling_exception']
____
A starvation free, strict fairness O(1) scalable design with
interactivity as good as the above restrictions can provide. There is no
interactivity estimator, no sleep/run measurements and only simple fixed
accounting. The design has strict enough a design and accounting that
task behaviour can be modelled and maximum scheduling latencies can be
predicted by the virtual deadline mechanism that manages runqueues. The
prime concern in this design is to maintain fairness at all costs
determined by nice level, yet to maintain as good interactivity as can
be allowed within the constraints of strict fairness.
____

== The Rotating Staircase Deadline Scheduler (RSDL)

(Complete description http://ck.wikia.com/wiki/RSDL[here].)

[.slider]
* One parameter: the *round-robin interval* (`RR_INTERVAL`).
* One input: a thread *priority*.

[.slider]
* Priority defines the levels at which each task can run.
** High priority tasks: *more* levels, *more* chances to run.
** Low priority tasks: *fewer* levels, *fewer* chances to run.
* Tasks can run for at most a fixed amount of time per level.
* Each level can also run for at most a fixed amount of time--ensures *bounded
latency*.

== RSDL

[.slider]
.To begin a scheduling epoch:
* Put all threads in a queue determined by their priority.
* Then:
[.slider]
. Run threads from the highest non-empty queue round-robin
[.slider]
. If a thread *blocks* or *yields*, it remains at that level
. If a thread runs out of its quota, it moves to the *next level down.*
. If the level runs out of _its_ quota, *all threads move to the next level
down.*
. Continue until all quotas are exhausted or no threads are runnable, then restart another epoch.

== Nice Features of RSDL

[.slider]
* Can easily calculate how long it will be before a thread at a certain
priority level runs given the number of runnable tasks in the system and
their priorities. *Easy to model.*
* Simple, fixed accounting. Scheduling can be done in O(1).
* More recent versions use *interleaving* to further reduce the delay
between tasks scheduling with different priorities:

[source,c,role='slide small']

PRIORITY:0..................20.................39
nice -20 0000000000000000000000000000000000000000

== Achieving Interactivity

[quote, Con Kolivas, role='spelling_exception']
____
This design relies on the fact that interactive tasks, by their nature, sleep
often. Most fair scheduling designs end up penalising such tasks indirectly
giving them less than their fair possible share because of the sleep, and
have to use a mechanism of bonusing their priority to offset this based on
the duration they sleep.
____

== Sounds Great! So Now What?

[.slider]
* Kolivas struggles to demonstrate that his scheduler is better than the
native scheduler. (Remember about desktop benchmarks?)
* Despite popularity with users, RSDL never leaves Con's private -ck
Linux kernel tree.
* Simultaneously, Ingo Molnar (remember him?) develops and integrates a
new Completely Fair Scheduler based on Kolivas' work.
* Con withdraws from the Linux community, citing the difficulty in
having multiple patches, including RSDL, accepted.

== To Rule Them All

[.slider]
* Interesting design question: does it make sense to rely on a *single
scheduler* given the diversity of devices Linux runs on?
* Kolivas proposed a *pluggable* scheduler architecture, parts of which
were later adopted.

== Moral?

[.slider]
* Find something to do that's fun.
* Get good at it.
* If you have good ideas, *they will carry the day*, even if your
implementation does not.

== ...He's [.spelling_exception]#Baaaccckkk!#

[.slider]
* In 2009 Kolivas returns with the Brain Fuck Scheduler, which continues
to try and achieve interactivity without sacrificing simplicity.

== BFS

[quote, Con Kolivas,role='smaller spelling_exception']
____
BFS is the Brain Fuck Scheduler. It was designed to be forward looking only,
make the most of lower spec machines, and not scale to massive hardware. ie it
is a desktop orientated scheduler, with extremely low latencies for excellent
interactivity by design rather than "calculated", with rigid fairness, nice
priority distribution and extreme scalability within normal load levels.
____

== Why Brain Fuck?

[.slider.small]
* Because it throws out everything about what we know is good about how
to design a modern scheduler in scalability.
* Because it's so ridiculously simple.
* Because it performs so ridiculously well on what it's good at despite
being that simple.
* Because it's designed in such a way that mainline would never be
interested in adopting it, which is how I like it.
* Because it will make people sit up and take notice of where the
problems are in the current design.
* Because it throws out the philosophy that one scheduler fits all and
shows that you can do a _lot_ better with a scheduler designed for a
particular purpose. I don't want to use a steamroller to crack nuts
* Because it actually means that more CPUs means better latencies.
* Because I must be fucked in the head to be working on this again.
