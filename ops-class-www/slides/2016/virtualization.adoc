* Why virtualize?

[.nooutline]
== $ cat announce.txt

* link:/asst/3/[ASST3].2 is due Friday @ 5PM.
* Schedule change today: virtualization is awesome!
* Please suggest topics for later in the class...

Read http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/research/srg/netos/papers/2003-xensosp.pdf["Xen
and the Art of Virtualization"] for Wednesday.

== What Is Virtualization?

Until today we've been talking about operating systems running on
*physical machines*: a collection of

[.slider]
. *real* hardware resources,
. that the operating system has *exclusive* access to
. through *hardware interfaces* (instruction set architectures, device
I/O ports, etc.

== What Is Virtualization?

Operating systems can also run inside *virtual machines (VMs)* implemented by
*virtual machine monitors (VMMs)*.

[.slider]
* We refer to an operating system running inside a virtual machine as a
*guest OS*.

[.slider]
.Virtual machines differ from physical machines in important ways.
* They _do not_ provide the guest OS with *exclusive* access to the
underlying physical machine.
* Equivalently, they _do not_ provide the guest OS with
*privileged* (or fully-privileged) access to the physical machine.

== What Is Virtualization?

[.slider]
.[.spelling_exception]#Et# voila: the *virtual machine monitor (VMM)* is
. a piece of software running on an operating system (the *host OS*)
. that can allow another operating system (the *guest OS*) to be run
as an application
. alongside other applications.

[.slider]
* When we said that the *operating system* was really _just another
program_ we weren't kidding!

== Why Virtualize?

(Clearly there is a big *how* question here, but let's start with *why*!)

[.slider]
* We've been talking about *operating systems* all semester...
* ...and I hope by this point I've convinced you that they are *pretty great*.

[.slide]

But just for the sake of argument... what might be some problems with the
operating system environments we've discussed thus far?
--

== Problems with Operating Systems: Hardware Coupling

[.slider]
.Unfortunate *coupling* between hardware resources and the operating system.
. Hard to run multiple operating systems on the same machine. (Geeky.)
. Difficult to transfer software setups to another machine, unless it
has identical or nearly identical hardware.
. Messy to adjust hardware resources to system needs. Requires
sticking your hand in the box and mucking around.
. Requires static, up-front provision of machine resources.

== Problems with Operating Systems: Application Isolation

[.slider]
.Lack of true *isolation* between multiple applications.
. Operating systems "leak" a lot of information between processes
through the file system and other channels.
. Multiple applications may require specific (and conflicting)
software packages to run.
. Certain applications may have very specific operating systems
configuration and tuning requirements.
. In some cases, software vendors _will not provide support_ if you
are running their precious application alongside *anything* else.

== Why We Virtualize

[.slider]
* We can package and distribute an entire software development
environment which can be used and discarded.
* We can dynamically divide up one large machine into multiple smaller
machines, each running a different operating system and applications.
* We can easily replicate an entire machine image in order to duplicate
or move it.

== To Be a VMM

In 1974 (!) [.spelling_exception]#Popek and Goldberg# provide three essential requirements for a
piece of software to be considered a *virtual machine monitor* (VMM), or to
implement a *virtual machine*:

[.slider]
. *Fidelity:* software on the VMM executes identically to how it would
on real hardware (modulo timing effects).
. *Performance:* to achieve good performance _most_ instructions
executed by the guest OS should be run directly on the underlying
physical hardware.
. *Safety:* the VMM should manage all hardware resources.

== Two Approaches to Virtualization

[.slider]
* *Full virtualization*. Should be able to run an *unmodified* guest OS. We
will discuss this today.
* *Paravirtualization*. Includes small changes to the guest operating
system to improve interaction with the virtual machine monitor. We will read
this paper for Monday.

== Full Virtualization

*Our goal:* run an *unmodified* operating system and applications in a VM
itself running on a host OS and potentially next to other VMs.

[.slider]
* *VMware* is the best-known provider of full virtualization software
solutions.

[.slider]
.Why is this hard?
* How do we handle traps by applications running in the guest OS?
* Guest OS will try to execute *privileged instructions*!

== [.spelling_exception]#De-Privileging# the Guest OS

[.slider]
.What happens if we run the Guest OS with *kernel* privileges?
* Privileged instructions work as expected, but guest has access to the
*entire machine*! (Violates safety.)

[.slider]
.What happens if we run the Guest OS with *user* privileges?
* Need to figure out how to deal with privileged instructions...

== Trapping Privileged Instructions

Ideally, when *privileged* instructions are run by the guest OS at
user privilege level:

[.slider]
. The CPU traps the instruction due to a *privilege violation*.
. The trap is handled by the VMM.
. Assuming the guest OS is doing something legitimate, the VMM adjusts
the VM state and continues the guest OS.

[.slider]
* We refer to an instruction set having this property as *classically
virtualizable*.
* We refer to the approach described above as *trap and emulate*.

== Trap and Emulate

[.slider]
.What does the VMM do with traps that occur within the virtual machine?
* If the trap is caused by an *application*, pass the trap to the guest
OS.
* If the trap is caused by the *guest OS*, handle the trap by adjusting
the state of the virtual machine.

== [.spelling_exception]#Getting Trappy#

VMware and VirtualBox VMMs run as standard system processes but
*require* operating system support.

[.slider]
* *All* traps and exceptions originating inside the VM _must_ be
handled by the VMM.
* Most of the time guest applications and the guest OS simply use the
physical processor *normally*.

<<<

[.slider]
.What happens when an application running _inside_ the virtual machine makes a system call?
. `syscall`: host OS vectors trap to VMM.
. VMM inspects trap, identifies it as a system call, and passes
control and arguments to the guest OS trap handling code.
. `rfe`: when the guest OS is done, it will also trap back to the VMM by
executing a privileged instruction.
. VMM will pass arguments back to the process that originated the
system call.

== [.spelling_exception]#Getting (Really) Trappy#

[.slider]
.What happens when a process inside the virtual machine creates a TLB fault?
. Trap to the *host OS*.
. Hand trap to the *VMM*.
. VMM inspects trap, sees that it was generated by the application,
passes control to the *guest OS*.
. Guest OS begins handling the TLB fault, tries to load an entry into the TLB.
. Trap to the *host OS*.
. Hand trap to the *VMM*.
. VMM inspects trap, sees that it was generated by the guest OS, adjusts the
state of the virtual machine appropriately.

== Hardware Virtualization

Note that what is being virtualized is the *hardware interface*.

Let's compare to *virtual memory*:

[.slider]
.What is the interface?
* *Load* and *store*.

[.slider]
.How do we ensure safety?
*Translate* _every_ unprivileged memory access.

[.slider]
.How do we get good performance?
* *Cache* translations in the TLB.

<<<

What about full hardware virtualization:

[.slider]
.What is the interface?
* *All* instructions executed on the processor that modify the state of the machine.

[.slider]
.How do we ensure safety?
* *Intercept* or *rewrite* unsafe instructions that could "pierce" the VM.

[.slider]
.How do we get good performance?
* Allow *safe* instructions to run directly on the physical hardware (or "bare metal").

== Sadly

The x86 architecture *is not* (or was not) classically virtualizable.

[.slider]
* Some instructions *did not trap correctly*.
* Others had *different side effects* when run in kernel or user mode. *Ugh.*

[.slider]
.VMware developed an innovative solution to this problem: *binary translation*.
* During guest OS execution scan code pages for non-virtualizable
instructions and rewrite them to safe instruction sequences.
* Cache translations to improve performance.

== A Short, Non-Exhaustive List of Cool Details I Have Glossed Over

[.slider]
* x86 privilege rings.
* Primary and shadow page tables.
* Memory traces.
* x86 extensions to better support virtualization.
* Lot's of good resources out there to learn more.

== Next Time

[.slider]
* Paravirtualization.
