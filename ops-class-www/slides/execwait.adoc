== Today

* Deadlock.
* `exec()`
* ``wait()``/``exit()``

[.nooutline]
== link:/asst/1/[ASST1] Checkpoint

[.slider]
//
.At this point:
//
* If you are not done, *you have three hours left!*
//
* Keep in mind: *you need working locks and CVs for future assignments.*
//
** (The rest of the assignment is for points and won't hurt you as much in the
future.)

[.nooutline]
== link:/asst/2/[ASST2] Checkpoint

[.slider]
//
* Get started!
//
* We'll distribute new `test161` targets this weekend.
//
* Your first task is to complete `sys_write`.

== Locking Multiple Resources

[.slider]
* *Locks* protect access to shared resources.
* Threads may need *multiple* shared resources to perform some
operation.

== Locking Multiple Resources

Consider two threads A and B that both need *simultaneous* access to
resources 1 and 2:

[.slider]
. *Thread A* runs, grabs the lock for *Resource 1*.
. → CONTEXT SWITCH ←
. *Thread B* runs, grabs the lock for *Resource 2*.
. → CONTEXT SWITCH ←
. *Thread A* runs, tries to acquire the lock for *Resource 2*.
. → THREAD A SLEEPS ←
. *Thread B* runs, tries to acquire the lock for *Resource 1*.
. → THREAD B SLEEPS ←

*Now what?*
--

== Deadlock

*Deadlock* occurs when a thread or set of threads are waiting for each
other to finish and thus nobody ever does.

== Self Deadlock

[.small]
--
[.slider]
.A *single thread* can deadlock. How?
* Thread A acquires Resource 1. Thread A tries to reacquire Resource 1.

[.slider]
.This seems inane. Why would this happen?
* `foo()` needs Resource 1. `bar()` needs Resource 1.
While locking Resource 1 `foo()` calls `bar()`.

[.slider]
.Can we solve this problem?
* *Yes!* Recursive locks. Allow a thread to reacquire a lock that it
already holds, as long as calls to acquire are matched by calls to
release.
* This kind of problem is not uncommon. You may want to implement
recursive locks for OS/161.
* (But don't make the locks we gave you suddenly recursive...)
--

== Conditions for Deadlock

[.slider]
.A deadlock *cannot occur* unless all of the following conditions are met:
* *Protected access* to shared resources, which implies waiting.
* *No resource preemption*, meaning that the system cannot forcibly
take a resource from a thread holding it.
* *Multiple independent requests*, meaning a thread can hold some
resources while requesting others.
* *Circular dependency graph*, meaning that Thread A is waiting for
Thread B which is waiting for Thread C which is waiting for Thread D
which is waiting for Thread A.

== Dining Philosophers

[.slider]
* "Classic" synchronization problem which I feel obligated to discuss.
* Illustrated below.

== Feeding Philosophers

[.slider]
.Breaking deadlock conditions usually requires eliminating one of the *requirements* for deadlock.
* *Don't wait*: don't sleep if you can't grab the second chopstick and
put down the first.
* *Break cycles*: usually by acquiring resources in a *well-defined
order*. Number chopsticks 0–4, always grab the higher-numbered chopstick
first.
* *Break out*: detect the deadlock cycle and forcibly take away a
resource from a thread to break it. (Requires a new mechanism.)
* *Don't make multiple independent requests*: grab *both* chopsticks at
once. (Requires a new mechanism.)

== Deadlock v. Starvation

[.slider]
.*Starvation* is an equally-problematic condition in which one or more threads do not make progress.
* Starvation differs from deadlock in that *some* threads make progress
and it is, in fact, those threads that are preventing the "starving"
threads from proceeding.

== Deadlock v. Race Conditions

What is better: a deadlock (perhaps from overly careful
synchronization) or a race condition (perhaps from a lack of correct
synchronization)?

[.slide]
--
I'll take the deadlock. *It's much easier to detect!*
--

== Using the Right Tool

[.slider]
* Most problems can be solved with a *variety* of synchronization
primitives.
* However, there is usually *one primitive* that is more appropriate
than the others.
* You will have a chance to practice picking synchronization primitives
for ASST1, and throughout the class.

== Approaching Synchronization Problems

[.slider]
. Identify the constraints.
. Identify shared state.
. Choose a primitive.
. Pair waking and sleeping.
. Look out for multiple resource allocations: can lead to deadlock.
. Walk through simple examples and corner cases *before* beginning to code.

== Review: After `fork()`

[source,c,role='small']
----
returnCode = fork();
if (returnCode == 0) {
  # I am the child.
} else {
  # I am the parent.
}
----

[.small.slider]
* The child thread returns executing at the exact same point that its
parent called `fork()`.
** With one exception: `fork()` returns *twice*, the PID to the parent and
0 to the child.
* All contents of memory in the parent and child are identical.
* Both child and parent have the same files open at the same position.
** *But, since they are sharing file handles changes to the file
offset made by the parent/child will be reflected in the child/parent!*

[.nooutline]
== Review: Issues with `fork()`

[.slider]
.Copying all that state is expensive!
* Especially when the next thing that a process frequently does is
start load a new binary which destroys most of the state `fork()` has
carefully copied!

[.slider]
.Several solutions to this problem:
* *Optimize existing semantics*: through copy-on-write, a clever
memory-management optimization we will discuss in several weeks.
* *Change the semantics*: `vfork()`, which will fail if the child does anything other than
immediately load a new executable.
** Does not copy the address space!

[.nooutline]
== Review: The Tree of Life

[.slider]
* `fork()` establishes a parent-child relationship between two process at
the point when each one is created.
* The `pstree` utility allows you to visualize these relationships.

== Let's Go On...

* Questions about `fork()`?

== $ wait %1 # Process lifecycle

[.slider]
* *Change:* `exec()`
* *Death:* `exit()`
* *The Afterlife:* `wait()`

== Groundhog Day

Is `fork()` enough?

== Change: `exec()`

[.slider]
* The `exec()` family of system calls replaces the calling process with a
new process loaded from a file.
* The executable file must contain a complete *blueprint* indicating how
the address space should look when `exec()` completes.
** What should the contents of memory be?
** Where should the first thread start executing?
* Linux and other UNIX-like systems use *ELF* (Executable and Linkable
Format) as the standard describing the information in the executable
file is structured.

== [.spelling_exception]#$ /lib/ld-linux.so.2#

image::figures/ldlinux.svg[width="100%"]

== `exec()` Argument Passing

[.slider]
* The process calling `exec()` passes arguments to the process that will
replace it *through the kernel.*
** The kernel retrieves the arguments from the process after the call to
`exec()` is made.
** It then pushes them in to the memory of the process where the
replacement process can find them when it starts executing.
** This is where main gets `argc` and `argv`!
* `exec()` also has an interesting return, almost the dual of `fork()`:
`exec()` *never* returns!

== `exec()` File Handle Semantics

[.slider]
* By convention exec does *not* modify the file table of the calling
process! Why not?
* Remember *pipes*?
** Don't undo all the hard work that `fork()` put in to duplicating the
file table!

== Next Time

[.slider]
* *Carl!*
* At this point we will head from outside looking in—or at the top of
the world looking down—and get deep inside the trenches to examine the
*thread* abstraction.
* Tentatively:
** One week on interrupts, kernel privileges, context switching and
threading.
** One week on scheduling.
