== Today

* Just files.
* File metadata.
* UNIX file system semantics.
* Hierarchical file systems.

[.nooutline]
== link:/asst/3/[`ASST3.1`] Checkpoint

.At this point:
//
* If you have not started `ASST3.1`, *you're behind.*
//
* If your coremap allocator is mostly working, you're OK.

*link:/asst/3/[`ASST3.1`] is due Friday at 5PM. No extensions.*

== Disks: Questions?

[.nooutline]
== Disk Parts

* *Platter:* [.slide]#a circular flat disk on which magnetic data is stored.
Constructed of a rigid non-magnetic material coated with a _very thin_
layer of magnetic material. Can have data written on both sides.#
* *Spindle:* [.slide]#the drive shaft on which multiple *platters* are mounted
and spun between 4200–15,000 RPM.#
* *Head:* [.slide]#the actuator that reads and writes data onto the magnetic
surface of the *platters* while rotating at tens of nanometers over the
platter surface.#

[.nooutline]
== Disk Locations

* *Track:* [.slide]#think of a lane on a race track running around the
platter.#
* *Sector:* [.slide]#resembles a slice of pie cut out of a single platter.#
* *Cylinder:* [.slide]#imagine the intersection between a cylinder and the set of
platters. Composed of a set of vertically-aligned tracks on all
platters.#

[.nooutline]
== Spinning Disks Are Different

Spinning disks are fundamentally different from the other system
components we have discussed so far.

* Difference in *kind*: [.slide]#disks *move*!#
* Difference in *degree*: [.slide]#disks are *slow*!#
* Difference in *integration*: [.slide]#disks are *devices*, and less
tightly-coupled to the abstractions built on top of them.#

[.nooutline]
== Sources of Slowness

Reading or writing from the disk requires a series of steps, each of
which is a potential source of latency.

. *Issue the command.* [.slide]#The operating system has to tell the device
what to do, the command has to cross the device interconnect (IDE, SATA,
etc.), and the drive has to select which head to use.#
. *Seek time.* [.slide]#The drive has to move the heads to the appropriate
track.#
. *Settle time.* [.slide]#The heads have to stabilize on the (very narrow)
track.#
. *Rotation time.* [.slide]#The platters have to rotate to the position where
the data is located.#
. *Transfer time.* [.slide]#The data has to be read and transmitted back across
the interconnect into system memory.#

[.nooutline]
== The I/O Crisis

Disks are getting [.slide]*bigger* but not [.slide]*faster*.

[.nooutline]
== Disks: Questions?

== File Systems To The Rescue

[.slider]
.Low-level disk interface is messy and very limited:
* Requires reading and writing entire 512-byte blocks.
* No notion of files, directories, etc.

[.slide]
--
File systems take this limited block-level device and create the *file
abstraction* almost _entirely in software_.
--

[.slider]
* Compared to the CPU and memory that we have studied previously *more*
of the file abstraction is implemented in software.
* This explains the plethora of available file systems: [.spelling_exception]#ext2,3 and 4,
reiserfs, NTFS, jfs, lfs, xfs#, etc.
* This is probably why many systems people have a soft spot for file
systems even if they seem a bit outdated these days.

== What About Flash?

No moving parts! Great! We can eliminate a lot of the complexity of
modern file systems. Yippee!

[.slider]
.Except that...
* Have to erase an entire large chunk before we can rewrite it.
* And it wears out faster that magnetic drives, and can wear unevenly
if we are not careful.

[.slide]
--
Sigh... things are sounding complicated again.
--

== Clarifying the Concept of a File

Most of us are familiar with files, but the semantics of file have a
variety of sources what are worth separating:

[.slider]
* *Just a file:* the minimum it takes to be a file.
* *About a file:* what other useful information do most file systems
_typically_ store about files?
* *Files and processes:* what additional properties does the UNIX file
system interface introduce to allow user processes to manipulate files?
* *Files together:* given _multiple_ files, how do we organize them in
a useful way?

== Just a File: The Minimum

[.slider]
.What does a file have to do to be useful?
* *Reliably* store data. (Duh.)
* Be located! Usually via a *name*.

image::figures/disks/filebasic.svg[image]

== Basic File Expectations

[.slider]
.At minimum we expect that
* file contents _should not_ change unexpectedly.
* file contents _should_ change when requested and as requested.

<<<
These requirements seem simple but many file systems *do not* meet them!

== Basic File Expectations

*Failures* such as power outages and sudden ejects make file system design difficult and
exposed tradeoffs between durability and performance.

* Memory: fast, transient. Disk: slow, stable.

== About a File: File Metadata

[.slider]
.What else might we want to know about a file?
* *When* was the file created, last accessed, or last modified?
* *Who* is allowed to what to the file—read, write, rename, change
other attributes, etc.
* Other file attributes?

== Where to Store File Metadata?

An MP3 file contains audio data. But it also has attributes
such as:

[.slider]
* title
* artist
* date

[.slider]
.Where should these attributes be stored?
* In the file itself.
* In another file.
* In _attributes_ associated with the file and maintained by the
file system.

== Where to Store File Metadata?

[.slider]
.*In the file*:
* Example: MP3 ID3 tag, a data container stored within an MP3 file in a
prescribed format.

[.slider]
* *Pro:* travels along with the file from computer to computer.
* *Con:* requires all programs that access the file to understand the
format of the embedded metadata.

<<<

[.slider]
.*In another file*:
* Example: iTunes database.

[.slider]
* *Pro:* can be maintained separately by each application.
* *Con:* does not move with the file and the separate file must be kept
in sync when the files it stores information about change.

<<<

[.slider]
.*In attributes*:
* Example: attributes have been supported by a variety of file systems
including prominently by BFS, the BeOS file system.

[.slider]
* *Pro:* maintained by the file system so can be queried and queried
quickly.
* *Con:* does not move with the file, and creates compatibility problems with
other file systems.

== Processes and Files: UNIX Semantics

[.small]
--
Many file systems provide an interface for establishing a
*relationship* between a process and a file.

[.slider]
* "I have the file open. I am using this file."
* "I am finished using the file and will close it now."

[.slider]
.Why does the file system want to establish these process-file relationships?
* Can improve *performance* if the OS knows what files are actively
being used by using caching or read-ahead.
* The file system may provide *guarantees* to processes based on this
relationship, such as exclusive access.

[.slider]
* Some file systems, particularly _networked_ file systems, don't even
bother to establish these relationships. (What happens if a networked
client opens a file exclusively and then dies?)
--

== File Location: UNIX Semantics

UNIX semantics simplify reads and writes to files by storing the file
position for processes.

[.slider]
* This is a convenience, not a requirement: processes could be required
to provide a position with every read and write.

== UNIX File Interface

[.slider]
.Establishing relationships:
* `open("foo")`: "I'd like to use the file named foo."
* `close("foo")`: "I'm finished with foo."

[.slider]
.Reading and writing:
* `read(2)`: "I'd like to perform a read from file handle 2 at the
current position."
* `write(2)`: "I'd like to perform a write from file handle 2 at the
current position."

[.slider]
.Positioning:
* `lseek(2, 100)`: "Please move my saved position for file handle 2 to position 100.
