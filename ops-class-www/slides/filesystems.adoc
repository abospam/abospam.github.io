== Today

* Hierarchical file systems.
* On-disk data structures.

[.nooutline]
== link:/asst/3/[`ASST3.1`] Checkpoint

.At this point:
//
* If you have not finished `ASST3.1`, *you're behind.*

*link:/asst/3/[`ASST3.1`] is due today at 5PM. No extensions.*

== UNIX File Interface

[.slider]
.Establishing relationships:
* `open("foo")`: "I'd like to use the file named foo."
* `close("foo")`: "I'm finished with foo."

[.slider]
.Reading and writing:
* `read(2)`: "I'd like to perform a read from file handle 2 at the
current position."
* `write(2)`: "I'd like to perform a write from file handle 2 at the
current position."

[.slider]
.Positioning:
* `lseek(2, 100)`: "Please move my saved position for file handle 2 to position 100.

== What's Missing?

[.slider]
* `dup2` is really about manipulating a processes names for files and
doesn't have much to do with the file system.

== Files Together: File Organization

Each file has to have a unique name. No problem!

[.slider]
* Letter to Mom: `LetterToMom.txt`
* Letter to Suzanna: `LetterToSuzanna.txt`
* Letter to Chuchu: `WoofWoofWagWag.txt`
* Another letter to Suzanna: `AnotherLetterToSuzanna.txt`
* A third letter to Suzanna: `LetterToSuzanna22Mar2012.txt`

[.slide]
--
Flat name spaces were actually used by some early file systems but
naming gets gross fast&hellip;
--

== Hierarchical Implications

Big idea: don't look at *everything* all at *once*. Allows users to
store and examine related files together.

[.slider]
* `letters/Mom/Letter.txt`
* `letters/Chuchu/WoofWoofWagWag.txt`
* `letters/Suzanna/Letters/1.txt`
* `letters/Suzanna/Letters/2.txt`
* `letters/Suzanna/Letters/2.txt`

[.slide]
--
Each file should be stored in *one* place. (Although we'll discuss
exceptions to this rule.)
--

== Location Implications

[.slider]
* Location requires navigation and _relative_ navigation is useful,
meaning that locations (directories) can include pointers to other
locations (other directories).
* Finally, location is only meaningful if it is tied to a files *name*,
so hierarchical file systems implement *name spaces*, which require that a
file's name map to a single unique location within the file system.

== Why Trees?

File systems usually require that files be organized into an _acyclic_
graph with a single _root_, also known as a _tree_.

Why?

[.slide.replace]

* What is the name of the file in the diagram below?

[.slide.replace]

* OK, I picked a root. What is the name of the file now?

image:figures/disks/cyclefilesystem.svg[image,width="35%"]
--

[.slide.replace]
--
* OK, I eliminated the cycles. What is the name of the file now?

image:figures/disks/treefilesystem.svg[image,width="35%"]
--

== Tree Naming

image:figures/disks/treefilesystem.svg[image,width="35%"]

Trees produce a *single* canonical name for each file on the system as
well as an infinite number of *relative* names:

[.slider.spelling_exception]
* *Canonical name:* /you/used/to/love/well
* *Relative name:* /you/used/to/love/me/../well
* *Relative name:* love/me/../../love/me/../well

== Files: Questions?

== File System Design Goals

[.slider]
. Efficiently *translate* file _names_ to file _contents_.
. Allow files to *move*, *grow*, *shrink* and otherwise *change*.
. Optimize access to *single* files.
. Optimize access to *multiple* files, particularly related files.
. *Survive* failures and maintain a consistent view of file names and contents.

== Three of These Things Are All Like Each Other

The file systems we will discuss all support the following features:
[.slider]
* *Files*, including some number of file attributes and permissions.
* *Names*, organized into a *hierarchical* name space.

[.slide]
--
This is the file interface and feature set we are all used to. The
difference lie in the implementations and what happens on disk.
--

== Implementing Hierarchical File Systems

[.slider]
.Broadly speaking, two types of disk blocks:
* *Data blocks*: contain file data.
* *Index nodes* (inodes): contain not file data.

== One of These Things Is Not Like the Others

[.slider]
.What makes file systems different?
* *On-disk layout.* How does the file system decide where to put data
and metadata blocks in order to optimize file access?
* *Data structures.* What data structures does the file system use to
translate names and locate file data?
* *Crash recovery.* How does the file system prepare for and recover
from crashes?

== File System Challenges

[.slider]
* File systems are really maintaining a large and complex *data
structure* using disk blocks as storage.
* This is hard because making changes potentially requires updating many
different structures.

== Example `write`

Say a process wants to `write` data to the end of a file. What does
the file system have to do?

[.slider]
. Find empty disk blocks to use and mark them as in use.
. Associate those blocks with the file that is being written to.
. Adjust the size of the file that is being written to.
. Actually copy the data to the disk blocks being used.

[.slider]
* From the perspective of a process all of these things need to happen
*synchronously*.
* In reality, *many different asynchronous* operations are involved
touching many different disk blocks. (Each operation above modifies at
least one disk block.)
* This creates both a consistency and a performance problem!

== What Happens On Disk?

Let's consider the *on-disk structures* used by modern file systems.

[.slider]
.Specifically we are going to investigate how file systems:
* *translate* paths to file _index nodes_ or inodes.
* *find* data blocks associated with a given inode (file).
* *allocate and free* inodes and data blocks.

[.slide]
--
We're going to try and keep this at a relatively high level, but
examples are used for concreteness and drawn from the Linux `ext4`
file system.
--

== Sectors, Blocks, Extents

[.slider]
* *Sector*: the smallest unit that the disk allows to be written,
usually *256* bytes.
* *Block*: the smallest unit that the file system actually writes,
usually *4K* bytes.
* *Extent*: a set of contiguous blocks used to hold part of a file.
Described by a start and end block.

[.slider]
.Why would file systems not write chunks smaller than 4K?
* Because contiguous writes are good for disk head scheduling and 4K is the
page size which affects in-memory file caching.

[.slider]
.Why would file systems want to write file data in even larger chunks?
* Because contiguous writes are good for disk head scheduling and many
files are larger than 4K!

[.nooutline]
== Next Time

* File system structures.
* File system operations.
* Caching.
