== Today

* Finding data blocks
* Caching and consistency

[.nooutline]
== link:/asst/3/[`ASST3.2`] Checkpoint

.At this point:
//
* If you have not started `ASST3.2`, *you're behind.*

*link:/asst/3/[`ASST3.2`] is due in less than 2 weeks. Get started!*

== `ext4` inodes

[.slider]
* *1* inode per file.
* *256* bytes, so 1 per sector or 16 per block.

[.slider]
.Contains:
* *Location* of file data blocks (contents).
* *Permissions* including user, read/write/execute bits, etc.
* *Timestamps* including creation (`crtime`), access
(`atime`), content modification (`mtime`), attribute modification (`ctime`)
and delete (`dtime`) times.
* Named and located by *number*.

== Locating inodes

[.slider]
.How does the system translate an inode number into an inode structure?
* All inodes are created at *format time* at well-known locations.

[.slider]
.What are the consequences of this?
* *inodes may not be located near file contents.* `ext4` creates multiple
blocks of inodes within the drive to reduce seek times between inodes and
data.
* Fixed number of inodes for the file system. *Can run out of inodes before we
run out of data blocks!* `ext4` creates approximately one inode per 16 KB of
data blocks, but this can be configured at format time.

== Directories

Simply a *special file* the contents of which map inode numbers to relative
names.

== File System Names are inode Numbers, Directories Are Files

== Using `debugfs`

== `open`: Path Name Translation

`open("/etc/default/keyboard")` must translate [.slide]`"/etc/default/keyboard"`
to an [.slide]*inode number.*

[.slider]
. Get inode number for *root directory*. This is usually a fixed
agreed-on inode number, like *2*.
. Open the directory with inode number 2. Look for `"etc"`. Find `"etc"`
with inode number *393218*.
. Open the directory with inode number 393218. Look for `"default"`.
Find `"default"` with inode number *393247*.
. Open the directory with inode number 393247. Look for `"keyboard"`.
Find keyboard with inode number *394692*.
. Open the file with inode number 394692.

== `read`/`write`: Retrieving and Modifying Data Blocks

[.slider]
* `read/write(filehandle, 345)` must translate [.slide]#345# to a
[.slide]#*data block* within the open file to determine what data block to
modify.#
* There are multiple ways of doing this.

== Data Blocks: Linked List

One solution: organize data blocks into a *linked list*.

[.slider]
* inode contains a pointer to the first data block.
* Each data block contains a pointer to the previous and next data
block.

[.slider]
.Pros:
* Simple.
* Small amount of information in inode.

[.slider]
.Cons:
* Offset look ups are *slow*! O(n) in the size of the file.

== Data Blocks: Flat Array

A second solution: store all data blocks in the inode in a single
array allocated at file creation time.

[.slider]
.Pros:
* Also simple.
* Offset look ups are fast, O(1).

[.slider]
.Cons:
* Small file size fixed at startup time.
* Large portion of array may be unused.

== Data Blocks: Multilevel Index

Observation: *most* files are small, but *some* can get very large.

[.slider]
.Have inode store:
* some pointers to blocks, which we refer to as *direct* blocks.
* some pointers to blocks containing pointers to blocks, which we refer
to as *indirect* blocks.
* some pointers to blocks containing pointers to blocks containing
pointers to blocks, which we refer to as *doubly indirect* blocks.
* etc...

== Data Blocks: Multilevel Index

image::figures/disks/multilevelindexblocks.svg[image]

== Data Blocks: Multilevel Index

[.slider]
.Pros:
* Index scales with the size of the file.
* Offset look ups are still fairly fast.
* Small files stay small, but big files can get extremely large.

[.nooutline]
== Next Time

* Consistency and caching.
* Journaling.
