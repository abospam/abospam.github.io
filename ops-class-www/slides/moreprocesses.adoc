== Today

. Finish IPC.
. File handles.
. Process life cycle:
** *Birth:* `fork()`
** *Change:* `exec()`
** *Death:* `exit()`
** *The Afterlife:* `wait()`

[.nooutline]
== $ cat announce.txt

[.slider]
* *Today is the add/drop deadline!*
* Recitations start this week and office hours continue.
* link:/asst/1/[ASST1] is due in _less than two weeks_.
* We will release changes to `test161` later this week and restart the
submission server.

== A Note on Partnering

[.slider]
* Both partners should be working together on each assignment.
* Working effectively with others is a life skill. It involves a degree of
patience and commitment by both parties:
** *Patience*: not getting too far ahead of your partner and doing all the
work
** *Commitment*: not getting too far behind your partner and dropping the ball
* Take ASST1 as your chance to test drive your partnership.
** Feel free to approach the course staff for help if needed.
* *We do not let students form new partnerships.* However, if you are really
struggling then we can let you work alone on ASST2 and ASST3.

[.nooutline]
== A Note on Grading

[.slider]
* My goal is to help everyone "make an A."
* If you are confused about anything, or have any doubts, email
`staff@ops-class.org` and we will reply promptly.

[.nooutline]
== A Note on Assignment Grading

[.slider]
* This year we have removed many of the free points from the
assignments--particularly the code reading questions.
* The goal is not to demoralize anyone. The goal is to ensure that you are
working on the parts of the assignments that are important.
* However, we *strongly* advise you to complete the recommended questions and
exercises.

[.nooutline]
== Last Time

[.slider]
.We discussed the *process* abstraction.
* Unfortunately at this point we are discussing an abstraction
(processes) built on other abstractions (threads, address spaces, files)
that we haven't discussed yet!
* There is a certain circularity to operating system design but we had
to break through at some point.
* Bear with me--we will get there and we will also keep returning to the
examples we've already introduced.
* Questions about material presented Friday?

== [.spelling_exception]#$ kill -9 ubshuttle # IPC: signals#

image:figures/signals.svg[width="100%"]

[.small.slider]
* Signals are a limited form of asynchronous communication between
processes.
* Processes can register a *signal handler* to run when a signal is
received.
* Users can send signals to processes owned by them; the super-user can
send a signal to any process.
* Processes can ignore most signals.
** `SIGKILL` is a notable exception; used for non-graceful termination.
** `SIGTERM` is used for graceful shutdown.

== We Will Return to IPC

[.slider]
* *return codes* -- we will discuss again when we learn about `wait()` and
`_exit()`.
** You will implement return codes for ASST2.
* *pipes* -- we will discuss again when we learn about `fork()`.
* *signals* -- are difficult to use and implement and not something we will
return to.
* *shared memory* -- we will discuss again when we learn about address
spaces and virtual memory.

== Processes v. Threads

[.small.slider]
* Potentially confusing due to overlapping terminology--we can describe
both a *process* and a *thread* as running.
* Terminology can be helpful for remembering the distinction:
** A computing *process* requires multiple resources: the CPU, memory,
files, etc.
** A *thread* of execution abstracts CPU state.
* Processes _contain_ threads; threads _belong_ to a process.
** Only one exception: the kernel may have threads of execution not
associated with any user process
** (Except the kernel process, which is a process, remember?)
* A process is considered to be running when one or more of its threads
are running.
* Different operating systems use different terminology, but share
common ideas.

== Process Example: Firefox

[.small]
--
[.slider]
.*Firefox has multiple threads. What are they doing?*
* Waiting for and processing interface events: mouse clicks, keyboard
input, etc.
* Redrawing the screen as necessary in response to user input, web page
loading, etc.
* Loading web pages--usually multiple parts _in parallel_ to speed
things up.

[.slider]
.*Firefox is using memory. For what?*
* Firefox.exe: the executable code of Firefox itself.
* Shared libraries for web page parsing, security, etc.
* Stacks storing local variables for running threads.
* A heap storing dynamically-allocated memory.

[.slider]
.*Firefox has files open. Why?*
* Configuration files.
* Fonts.

== Process Example: bash

[.slider]
* Let's do this for real using standard Linux system utilities.

== Finding bash

image::figures/finding-bash.svg[width="100%"]

[.slider]
* `ps aux` gives me all process, then `grep` for the one I'm after.
* ...or, do it all in one shot using `pgrep`.
* ...or, if I know it's running in my current session a bare `ps` will do.

== bash

image::figures/process-bash-3.svg[width="100%"]

== [.spelling_exception]#$ ps -Lf # thread information#

image::figures/threads-bash.svg[width="100%"]

[.small.slider]
.What are:
* `UID`: user the process is running as.
* `PID`: process ID.
* `PPID`: parent process ID.
* `PRI`: scheduling priority.
* `SZ`: size of the core image of the process (kB).
* `WCHAN`: if the process is not running, description of what it is
waiting on.
* `RSS`: total amount of resident memory is use by the process (kB).
* `TIME`: measure of the amount of time that the process has spent
running.

== [.spelling_exception]#$ ps -Lf # thread information#

image::figures/threads-bash.svg[width="100%"]

[.slider]
* If `bash` had multiple threads running this view would show them, so
`bash` does not have multiple threads.

== bash

image::figures/process-bash-2.svg[width="100%"]

== $ ps # process information

[.slider]
* I wish we could see a process with multiple threads...

== [.spelling_exception]#$ ps -Lf # thread information#

image::figures/ps-threads.svg[width="90%", role="expand"]

== $ pmap # memory mappings

image::figures/pmap.svg[width="100%"]

[.nooutline]
== Next Time

* `fork` and file handles
* The process lifecycle:
** *birth* (`fork()`),
** *change* (`exec()`),
** *death* (`exit()`), and
** *heaven* (`wait()`).
