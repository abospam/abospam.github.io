== Today

* Locating page state.

== Page State

[.slider]
.In order to keep the TLB up-to-date we need to be able to:
* *Store* information about each virtual page.
* *Locate* that information quickly.

== Page Table Entries (PTEs)

We refer to a single entry storing information about a single virtual
page used by a single process a *page table entry (PTE)*.

[.slider]
* (We will see in a few slides why we call them *page table* entries.)
* Can usually jam everything into one 32-bit machine word:
** *Location*: 20 bits. (Physical Page Number or location on disk.)
** *Permissions*: 3 bits. (Read, Write, Execute.)
** *Valid*: 1 bits. Is the page located in memory?
** *Referenced*: 1 bits. Has the page been read/written to recently?

== Locating Page State

[.slider]
* _Process:_ "Machine! Store to address `0x10000`!"
* _MMU:_ "Where the heck is virtual address `0x10000` supposed to map to?
Kernel...help!"
* (Exception.)
* _Kernel_: Let's see... where did I put that page table entry for
`0x10000`... just give me a minute... I know it's around here somewhere...
I really should be more organized!

[.slider]
.What are the requirements for how we locate page information?
* *Speed*: translation is a _hot path_ and should be as efficient as
possible.
* *Compactness*: data structures we use should not take up too much
physical memory.

== Page Tables

The data structure used to quickly map a *virtual page number* to a *page
table entry* is called a *page table*.

[.slider]
* Each process has a _separate_ page table.
* *Why?* [.slide]#Virtual addresses are private to each process and
translated differently for each.#

== Flat Page Tables

*Approach*: use one array to hold all page table entries for each process.
Virtual page number is index into this array.

== Flat Page Tables

* *Approach*: use one array to hold all page table entries for each
process. Virtual page number is index into this array.

[.slider]
* *Speed*: O(1). VPN is used directly as an index into the array.
* *Compactness*: *4 MB* per process that may have to be *contiguous*!
Most is *unused*!

== Linked List Page Tables

[.slider]
* *Approach*: list of PTEs for each process, searched on each
translation.

== Linked List Page Tables

*Approach*: list of PTEs for each process, searched on each
translation.

[.slider]
* *Speed*: O(n) for n valid virtual pages.
* *Compactness*: *4 bytes * n* for n valid virtual pages. All entries
are used!

== [.spelling_exception]#An Early ASST3 K.I.S.S.:#

Don't feel like you have to do something overly complicated for ASST3!
First get it right, then optimize.

== Multi-Level Page Tables

*Approach*: build a tree-like data structure mapping VPN to PTE. Break
VPN into multiple parts, each used as an index at a separate level of
the tree.

[.slider]
* Example: with 4K pages VPN is *20* bits. Use *top 10* bits as index
into *top-level* page table, *bottom 10 bits* as index into second-level
page table.
** Each page table is 2^10^ * 4 bytes = 4K. Convenient!

== Multi-Level Page Tables

Build a tree-like data structure mapping VPN to PTE. Break VPN into multiple
parts, each used as an index at a separate level of the tree.

[.slider]
* *Speed*: O(c). Constant number of look ups per translation depending on
tree depth.
* *Compactness*: Depends on sparsity of address space, but better than
flat and worse than linked list.

== Out of Core

So far we have been talking about cases where processes are able to use
the physical memory available on the machine.

But what happens when we *run out*?

== Out of Core

When we *run out*, there are two options:
[.slider]
. *Fail*, and either don't load the process (`exec()`), don't create a
new process (`fork()`), refuse to allocate more heap (`sbrk()`), or kill the
process if it is trying to allocate more stack.

. *Create more space*, preserving the contents of memory for later use.

== Virtually Sneaky

Virtual address translation gives the kernel the ability to remove
memory from a process *behind its back*.

[.slider]
.What are the requirements for doing this?
* The _last time_ the process used the virtual address, it behaved like
memory.
* The _next time_ the process uses the virtual address, it behaves like
memory.
* In between, whatever data was stored at that address must be
*preserved*.

[.nooutline]
== Next Time

[.slider]
* Swapping. How do we remove a page?
* Page replacement algorithms. How do we choose a page to remove?
