[.nooutline]
== Errata

[.slider]
//
* *Pre-class music*: if you have suggestions, please stop by my office hours.
One request per student per semester and requests must be made in person.
//
* *Travel*: I will probably be traveling a bit more than usual this semester.
//
Either one of the TAs will fill in for me while I'm gone, or we'll show videos
from last year.

== ASST0 Setup

* Today we're going to walk through getting started with link:/asst/0/[ASST0].

* To the terminal!

== How to Survive This Class

I want this class to be as enjoyable as possible.
//
*That's the best way to learn.*
//
But here's how to avoid dark and desperate moments.

[.slider]
//
* *Learn to type.* If you don't know how, it will slow down _everything else_.
//
** https://10fastfingers.com/typing-test/english[Here's a test.] (My best
score is in the 100 words-per-minute range.)
//
* Start assignments early.
//
* Work frequently and often.
//
* Schedule time to attend office hours with your partner. I'd suggest at least
4 hours per week, but more is better.

[.slider]
//
* Pair program with your partner:
//
** One person hacking, the other observing.
//
** You *do not* want to introduce bugs into your kernel.
//
* Liberally use `KASSERT`.
//
* Write tests.
//
* Find a way to iterate quickly and limit the number of untested lines.
//
* Break your code into small, easily tested functions.

== Next Time

* Meet the operating system.
