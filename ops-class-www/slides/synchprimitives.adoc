== Today

.Synchronization Primitives
** Critical sections
** Spinlocks
** Locks

[.nooutline]
== link:/asst/1/[ASST1] Checkpoint

[.slider]
//
.At this point:
//
* If you have not started, *you're way behind.*
//
* If you don't understand semaphores, *you're way behind.*
//
* If you only have working locks, *you're behind.*
//
* If you have working CVs, *you're behind.*
//
* If you have solved _only one_ of the synchronization problems or have working
reader-writer locks, *you're a bit behind.*
//
* If you've solved two, you're OK.
//
* Keep in mind: *you need working locks and CVs for future assignments.*
//
** (The rest of the assignment is for points and won't hurt you as much in the
future.)

== Fast Forward: Synchronization

[.slider]
.What you need to know
* The OS creates the _illusion of concurrency_ by quickly switching the
processor(s) between multiple threads
** We will back up and discuss how this happens after discussion
synchronization
* *Threads* are used to abstract and multiplex the CPU

== Pandora's Concurrency Box

[.slider]
.The illusion of concurrency is both *powerful* and *useful*:
** It helps us think about how to structure our applications.
** It hides latencies caused by slow hardware devices.

[.slider]
.Unfortunately, concurrency also creates *problems*:
* *Coordination*: how do we enable efficient communication between the
multiple threads involved in performing a single task?
* *Correctness*: how do we ensure that shared state remains consistent
when being accessed by multiple threads concurrently? How do we enforce
time-based semantics?
* We will focus on *correctness* today but return to *coordination*
later.

== Patient 0

[.slider]
.The *operating system* itself is one of the most difficult concurrent programs to write. Why?
* It is multiplexing access to hardware resources and therefore sharing
a great deal of state between multiple processes!
* It frequently uses many threads to hide hardware delays while
servicing devices and application requests.
* *Lots of shared state* plus *lots of threads* equals a difficult
synchronization problem.
* Also, if the operating system gets synchronization wrong *bad things
happen*.

== Concurrency v. Parallelism

The https://golang.org/[Go developers] have a great description of this
distinction. http://blog.golang.org/concurrency-is-not-parallelism[According
to them]:

[.small]
--
[quote]
...when people hear the word concurrency they often think of parallelism, a
related but quite distinct concept. In programming, concurrency is the
composition of independently executing processes, while parallelism is the
simultaneous execution of (possibly related) computations. Concurrency is
about dealing with lots of things at once. Parallelism is about doing lots of
things at once.

== Unless Shown Otherwise...

Concurrency forces us to relax any assumptions that we may want to make about how any particular thread executes.

[.slider]
.Unless explicitly synchronized, threads may:
. Be run in *any order*,
. Be stopped and restarted at *any time*,
. Remain stopped for *arbitrary lengths of time*.

[.slider]
* Generally these are *good things*â€”the operating system is making
choices about how to allocate resources.
* When accessing shared data these are *challenges* that force us to
program more carefully.

== The Bank Example

Consider the following code snippet.

[source,c,linenums,role='smaller']
----
void giveGWATheMoolah(account_t account, int largeAmount) {
  int gwaHas = get_balance(account);
  gwaHas = gwaHas + largeAmount;
  put_balance(account, gwaHas);
  notifyGWAThatHeIsRich(gwaHas);
  return;
}
----

[.slider]
.Assume I have *$1,000* and that *two* of you are trying to make deposits concurrently:
* One of you is depositing *$1,000* (this person gets a B).
* One of you is depositing *$2,000* (A- material).

== Race Conditions

A *race condition* is "when the output of a process is unexpectedly
dependent on timing or other events."

[.slider]
.Note that the definition of a race depends on what we *expected* to happen:
* We expected me to have *$4,000* after both deposits. (Otherwise we
are not observing the Law of the Conversation of Money, probably
important to banks except during bailouts.)

== Concurrency v. Atomicity

[.slider]
.*Concurrency:* the illusion that multiple things are happening at once.
* Requires stopping or starting any thread at any time.

[.slider]
.*Atomicity:* the illusion that a set of separate actions occurred *all at once*.
* Requires not stopping certain threads at certain times or not
starting certain threads at certain times, i.e. providing some limited
control to threads over their scheduling.

== Critical Sections

[.slider]
.A *critical section* contains a series of instructions that only one thread can be executing at any given time.
* This set (or sets) of instructions will look atomic with respect to
*other threads executing code within the critical section*.

== Critical Sections

[source,c,linenums,role='smaller']
----
void giveGWATheMoolah(account_t account, int largeAmount) {
  int gwaHas = get_balance(account);
  gwaHas = gwaHas + largeAmount;
  put_balance(account, gwaHas);
  notifyGWAThatHeIsRich(gwaHas);
  return;
}
----

.In order to implement the previous example correctly:
. What is local state private to each thread? [.slide]*gwaHas*
. What is the shared state that is being accessed by giveGWATheMoolah?
[.slide]*account*
. What lines are in the critical section? [.slide]*2-4*

== Critical Section Requirements

[.slider]
* *Mutual Exclusion:* this is the most basic property. Only one thread
should be executing in the critical section at one time.
* *Progress:* all threads should eventually be able to proceed through
the critical section.
* *Performance:* we want to keep critical sections as small as possible
without sacrificing correctness.
