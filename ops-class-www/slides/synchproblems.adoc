.At this point:
//
* If you have not started, *you're way, way behind.*
//
* If you don't understand semaphores, *you're way, way behind.*
//
* If you only have working locks, *you're way behind.*
//
* If you have working CVs, *you're way behind.*
//
* If you have solved _only one_ of the synchronization problems or have working
reader-writer locks, *you're behind.*
//
* If you've solved two, you're OK.
//
* Keep in mind: *you need working locks and CVs for future assignments.* And
ASST2.1 is due a week after ASST1.
//
** (The rest of the assignment is for points and won't hurt you as much in the
future.)

== Today

* Spinlocks, locks, and condition variables.
* Problems *with* synchronization primitives:
** Deadlock.
* Problems *using* synchronization primitives:
** Bounded buffer producer-consumer.
* Choosing the right primitive.

== Implementing Critical Sections

[.slider]
* Two possible approaches. *Don't stop*, or *don't enter*.
* *On uniprocessors* a single thread can prevent other threads from
executing in a critical section by simply not being descheduled.
** In the kernel we can do this by *masking* interrupts. No timer, no
scheduler, no stopping.
** *In the multicore era this is only of historical interest.* (This
design pattern is usually broken.)
* More generally we need a way to force other threads—potentially
running on other cores—*not to enter* the critical section while one
thread is inside. *How do we do this?*

== Atomic Instructions

Software synchronization primitives utilize *special hardware
instructions* guaranteed to be atomic across all cores:

[.slider]
* *Test-and-set*: write a memory location and return its old value.

[source,c,linenums,role='smaller slide']
----
int testAndSet(int * target, int value) {
  oldvalue = *target;
  *target = value;
  return oldvalue;
}
----

<<<<

[.slider]
* *Compare-and-swap*: compare the contents of a memory location to a
given value. If they are the same, set the variable to a new given
value.

[source,c,linenums,role='smaller slide']
----
bool compareAndSwap(int * target, int compare, int newvalue) {
  if (*target == compare) {
    *target = newvalue;
    return 1;
  } else {
    return 0;
  }
}
----

<<<<

[.slider]
* *Load-link and store-conditional*: Load-link returns the value of a memory
address, while the following store-conditional succeeds *only if* the value
has not changed since the load-link.

[source,c,linenums,role='smaller slide']
----
y = 1;
__asm volatile(
    ".set push;"     /* save assembler mode */
    ".set mips32;"   /* allow MIPS32 instructions */
    ".set volatile;" /* avoid unwanted optimization */
    "ll %0, 0(%2);"  /*   x = *sd */
    "sc %1, 0(%2);"  /*   *sd = y; y = success? */
    ".set pop"       /* restore assembler mode */
    : "=r" (x), "+r" (y) : "r" (sd));
if (y == 0) {
  return 1;
}
----

== Atomic Instructions

[.slider]
* Many processors provide either *test and set* or *compare and swap*.
* On others equivalents can be implemented in software using other
atomic hardware instructions.

== The Bank Example: Test and Set

Let's modify our earlier example to use a test and set:

[source,c,linenums,role='slide replace smaller']
----
void giveGWATheMoolah(account_t account, int largeAmount) {
  int gwaHas = get_balance(account);
  gwaHas = gwaHas + largeAmount;
  put_balance(account, gwaHas);
  notifyGWAThatHeIsRich(gwaHas);
  return;
}
----

[source,c,linenums,role='slide replace smaller end']
----
+int payGWA = 0; // Shared variable for our test and set.

void giveGWATheMoolah(account_t account, int largeAmount) {
+ testAndSet(&payGWA, 1); # Set the test and set.
  int gwaHas = get_balance(account);
  gwaHas = gwaHas + largeAmount;
  put_balance(account, gwaHas);
+ testAndSet(&payGWA, 0); # Clear the test and set.
  notifyGWAThatHeIsRich(gwaHas);
  return;
}
----

[.slide]
--
*Does this work?* [.slide]#No! How do I tell if another thread has already set `payGWA`?#
--

== The Bank Example: Test and Set

Let's try again:

[source,c,linenums,role='slide replace smaller']
----
void giveGWATheMoolah(account_t account, int largeAmount) {
  int gwaHas = get_balance(account);
  gwaHas = gwaHas + largeAmount;
  put_balance(account, gwaHas);
  notifyGWAThatHeIsRich(gwaHas);
  return;
}
----

[source,c,linenums,role='slide replace smaller end']
----
+int payGWA = 0; // Shared variable for our test and set.

void giveGWATheMoolah(account_t account, int largeAmount) {
+ if (testAndSet(&payGWA, 1) == 1) {
+   // But then what?
+ }
  int gwaHas = get_balance(account);
  gwaHas = gwaHas + largeAmount;
  put_balance(account, gwaHas);
+ testAndSet(&payGWA, 0); # Clear the test and set.
  notifyGWAThatHeIsRich(gwaHas);
  return;
}
----

[.slider]
* But what should I do if the `payGWA` is set?

== The Bank Example: Test and Set

[source,c,linenums,role='slide replace smaller']
----
void giveGWATheMoolah(account_t account, int largeAmount) {
  int gwaHas = get_balance(account);
  gwaHas = gwaHas + largeAmount;
  put_balance(account, gwaHas);
  notifyGWAThatHeIsRich(gwaHas);
  return;
}
----

[source,c,linenums,role='slide replace smaller end']
----
+int payGWA = 0; // Shared variable for our test and set.

void giveGWATheMoolah(account_t account, int largeAmount) {
+ while (testAndSet(&payGWA, 1) == 1) {
+   ; // Test it again!
+ }
  int gwaHas = get_balance(account);
  gwaHas = gwaHas + largeAmount;
  put_balance(account, gwaHas);
+ testAndSet(&payGWA, 0); # Clear the test and set.
  notifyGWAThatHeIsRich(gwaHas);
  return;

[.small.slider]
.What are the *problems* with this approach?
* *Busy waiting*: threads wait for the critical section by "pounding on
the door", executing the TAS repeatedly.
* Bad on a multicore system. Worse on a single core system! *Busy
waiting prevents the thread in the critical section from making
progress!*

== Locks

[.slider]
.*Locks* are a synchronization primitive used to implement critical sections.
* Threads *acquire* a lock when entering a critical section.
* Threads *release* a lock when leaving a critical section.

== Spinlocks

[.slider]
.What we have implemented today is known as a *spinlock*:
* *lock* for the fact that it guards a critical section (we will have
more to say about locks next time), and
* *spin* describing the process of acquiring it.

[.slide]
--
Spinlocks are *rarely used* on their own to solve synchronization
problems.
--

[.slide]
--
Spinlocks are *commonly used* to build more useful synchronization
primitives.

== More Bank Example

[source,c,linenums,role='slide replace smaller']
----
void giveGWATheMoolah(account_t account, int largeAmount) {
  int gwaHas = get_balance(account);
  gwaHas = gwaHas + largeAmount;
  put_balance(account, gwaHas);
  notifyGWAThatHeIsRich(gwaHas);
  return;
}
----

[source,c,linenums,role='slide replace smaller end']
----
lock gwaWalletLock; // Need to initialize somewhere

void giveGWATheMoolah(account_t account, int largeAmount) {
+ lock_acquire(&gwaWalletLock);
  int gwaHas = get_balance(account);
  gwaHas = gwaHas + largeAmount;
  put_balance(account, gwaHas);
+ lock_release(&gwaWalletLock);
  notifyGWAThatHeIsRich(gwaHas);
  return;
}
----

[.slider]
.What happens if we call `lock_acquire()` while another thread is in the critical section?
* *The thread acquiring the lock must wait until the thread holding the
lock calls `lock_release()`*.

== How To Wait

[.slider]
.*How* do we wait?
* *Active* (or busy) waiting: repeat some action until the lock is
released.
* *Passive* waiting: tell the kernel what we are waiting for, go to
sleep, and rely on `lock_release` to awaken us.

== Spinning v. Sleeping

[.slider]
.There are cases where spinning is the right thing to do. *When?*
* Only on multicore systems. Why?
[.slider]
** On single core systems *nothing can change* unless we allow another thread
to run!
* If the critical section is *short*.
[.slider]
** Balance the length of the *critical section* against the overhead of a *context switch*.

== When to Spin

If the critical section is *short*:

== When to Sleep

If the critical section is *long*:

image::figures/synch/spinlocks.svg[width="70%"]
--

== How to Sleep

[.slider]
.The kernel provides functionality allowing kernel threads to sleep and wake on a *key*:
* `thread_sleep(key)`: "Hey kernel, I'm going to sleep, but please wake
me up when *`key`* happens."
* `thread_wake(key)`: "Hey kernel, please wake up all (or one of) the
threads who were waiting for *`key`*."
* Similar functionality can be implemented in user space.

== Thread Communication

[.slider]
* Locks are designed to protect *critical sections*.
* `lock_release()` can be considered a *signal* from the thread inside the
critical section to other threads indicating that they can proceed.
** In order to receive this signal a thread *must be sleeping*.
* What about other kinds of signals that I might want to deliver?
** The buffer has data in it.
** Your child has exited.

== Condition Variables

[.slider]
* A *condition variable* is a signaling mechanism allowing threads to:
** `cv_wait` until a *condition* is true, and
** `cv_notify` other threads when the condition becomes true.
* The *condition* is usually represented as some change to shared state.
** The buffer has data in it: *`bufsize > 0`*.
** `cv_wait`: notify me when the buffer has data in it.
** `cv_signal`: I just put data in the buffer, so notify the threads that
are waiting for the buffer to have data.

== Condition Variables

[.slider]
* *Condition variable* can convey *more information* than locks about
some change to the state of the world.
* As an example, a buffer can be *full*, *empty*, or *neither*.
** If the buffer is *full*, we can let threads withdraw but not add
items.
** If the buffer is *empty*, we can let threads add but not withdraw
items.
** If the buffer is neither full nor empty, we can let threads add and
withdraw items.
* We have *three* different buffer states (full, empty, or neither) and
*two* different threads (producer, consumer).

== Condition Variables

[.slider]
.Why are condition variables a synchronization mechanism?
* Want to ensure that the condition *does not change* between checking it
and deciding to wait!
