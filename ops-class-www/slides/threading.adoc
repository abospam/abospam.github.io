[.nooutline]
== Today

* Threads.
* Threading implementations: user v. kernel.
* Thread states.

[.nooutline]
== Review: Thread Transitions

A transition between two threads is called a [.slide]#*context switch*#.

[.nooutline]
== Review: CPU Limitations

[.slider]
.What are problems with the CPU that the operating system tries to correct?
* There is only one, and
* it is way faster than other parts of the system.

[.nooutline]
== Review: Batch Scheduling

[.slider]
.What is batch scheduling?
* Running jobs sequentially until completion.

[.slider]
.What is the problem with batch scheduling?
* Slow devices can idle the CPU.

[.nooutline]
== [.small]#Review: The Illusion of Concurrency#

[.slider]
.How does the operating system create the illusion of concurrency?
* By *rapidly switching* the CPU between multiple running tasks.

[.nooutline]
== Review: Seize the Day

[.slider]
.How does the operating system ensure that it retains control over what threads are using the CPU?
* By using a *periodic timer* to generate hardware interrupts.

[.nooutline]
== [.small]#Review: The Illusion of Concurrency#

[.slider]
* Timer interrupts mean that a running thread may be stopped *at any time.*
* When the thread restarts we want it to _appear_ that nothing has happened.

[.nooutline]
== Review: Saving Thread State

[.slider]
.What does thread state consist of?
* *Registers*
* *Stack*

[.nooutline]
== Review: Context Switch Overhead

[.slider]
* Context switches are *not free*, require executing many instructions
and saving fair amount of state.
* Context switching creates the *cost* to enter the kernel.

[.slider]
.How does this affect the rate at which the hardware timer fires to allow the kernel to (potentially) switch between threads?
* Can't go *too fast* otherwise overhead starts to dominate!

[.nooutline]
== Questions: CPU Limitations, Concurrency, Context Switching?

== Threads

[.slider]
.So what is a thread?
* Registers
* Stack

[.slider]
.How are each of the following shared between threads or processes?
* Registers
* Stack
* Memory
* File descriptor table.

== Why Use Threads?

[.slider]
. Threads can be a good way of thinking about applications that do multiple things "simultaneously."
. Threads may naturally encapsulate some data about a certain thing that the application is doing.
. Threads may help applications hide or parallelize delays caused by slow devices.

[.small]
== Threads v. Processes Part II

Good example from Wikipedia: multiple threads within a single process
are like multiple cooks trying to prepare the same meal together.

image::figures/threads/kitchen.svg[width="40%"]

[.slider]
* Each one is doing one thing.
* They are probably doing different things.
* They all share the same recipe but may be looking at different parts
of it.
* They have private state but can communicate easily.
* They must coordinate!

== Aside: Threads v. Events

[.slider]
* While threads are a reasonable way of thinking about concurrent programming,
they are not the only way--or even always the _best_ way--to make use of
system resources.
* Another approach is known as
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Event-driven_programming[event-driven programming].
* Anyone who has done JavaScript development or used frameworks like
http://nodejs.org/[node.js] has grown familiar with this programming model.

[.slider]
.Events v. threads (over)simplified:
* Threads *can block*, so we make use of the CPU by switching between
threads!
* Event handlers *cannot block*, so we can make use of the CPU by simply
running events until completion.

== [.small]#Naturally Multithreaded Applications#

[.slider]
.Web server:
* Use a separate thread to handle each incoming request.

[.slider]
.Web browser:
* Separate threads for each open tab.
* When loading a page, separate threads to request and receive each
unique part of the page.

[.slider]
.Scientific applications:
** Divide-and-conquer "embarrassingly parallelizable" data sets.

== Why Not Processes?

[.slider]
* IPC is more difficult because the kernel tries to protect processes
from each other.
** Inside a single process, anything goes!
* State (what?) associated with processes doesn't scale well.

== Implementing Threads

[.small]
--
[.slider]
.Threads can be implemented in user space by unprivileged libraries.
* This is the M:1 threading model, M user threads that look like 1
thread to the operating system kernel.

[.slider]
.Threads can be implemented by the kernel directly.
* This is the 1:1 threading model.

== Implementing Threads in User Space

[.slider]
.How is this possible?
* Doesn't involve multiplexing between processes so no kernel privilege
required!

[.slider]
.How do I:
* *Save and restore context?* [.slide]#This is just saving and restoring
registers. The C library has an implementation called ``setjmp()``/``longjmp()``.#
* *Preempt other threads?* [.slide]#Use periodic signals delivered by the
operating system to activate a user space thread scheduler.#

== Aside: ``setjmp()``/``longjmp()`` Wizardry

What will the following code do?

[cols="2*"]

[source,c,role='smallest']

int main(int argc, void * argv) {
  int i, restored = 0;
  jump_buf saved;
  for (i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    printf("Value of i is now %d\n", i);
    if (i == 5) {
      printf("OK, saving state...\n");
      if (setjmp(saved) == 0) {
        printf("Saved CPU state.\n");
        break;
      } else {
        printf("Restored CPU state.\n");
        restored = 1;
      }
    }
  }
  if (!restored) {
    longjmp(saved, 1);
  }
}

Value of i is now 0
Value of i is now 1
Value of i is now 2
Value of i is now 3

Saved CPU state.
Restored CPU state.

== [.small]#Comparing Threading Implementations#

*M:1 (user space) threading*

[.slider]
.Pros:
* Threading operations are much faster because they do not have to
cross the user/kernel boundary.
* Thread state can be smaller.

[.slider]
.Cons:
* Can't use multiple cores!
* Operating system may not schedule the application correctly because
it doesn't know about the fact that it contains more than one thread.
* A single thread may block the entire process in the kernel when there
are other threads that could run.

== [.small]#Comparing Threading Implementations#

*1:1 (kernel) threading*

[.slider]
.Pros:
* Scheduling might improve because kernel can schedule all threads in
the process.

[.slider]
.Cons:
* Context switch overhead for all threading operations.

[.nooutline]
== Next: Thread Scheduling

* We have discussed the mechanisms (context switching) used the multiplex
the CPU...
* and the abstraction (threads).
* We will start talking about scheduling next week: the *policies* the ensure
that the multiplexing makes the best use of the available system resources.
