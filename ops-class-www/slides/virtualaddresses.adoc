== Today: Address Translation

* Levels of indirection.
* Physical and virtual addresses.
* Virtual address properties.

[.nooutline]
== link:/asst/2/[`ASST2`] Checkpoint

.At this point:
//
* If you have not finished `ASST2.1`, *you're way, way behind.*
//
* If you have not finished the file system system calls `sys_{open,close,lseek}...`, *you're behind.*
//
* If you finished one of `sys_{fork,wait,exec,exit}`, you're OK.

== Convention

[.slider]
* Process layout is specified by the Executable and Linker Format (ELF)
file. (Remember ELF?)
* Some layout is the function of *convention*.
* Example: why not load the code at `0x0`?
** To catch possibly the most common programmer error: `NULL` pointer
problems!
** Leaving a large portion of the process address space starting at `0x0`
empty allows the kernel to catch these errors, including offsets against
`NULL` caused by `NULL` structures:

[source,c,role='smaller slide']
----
struct bar * foo = NULL;
foo->bar = 10;
----

Segmentation fault

[.nooutline]
== Aside: ASST2

[source,c,role='small']
----
int32_t sys_open(userptr_t pathname, ...) {
  if (pathname == NULL) {
    return EINVAL;
  }
  ...
----

This is also why *not* to check `userptr_t` types for `NULL` in ASST2:

[.slider]
* `0x0` can be a valid user address. ("Look, Mom, I did my own linking.")
* There are `2^31` ways that address can be bogus...[.slide]#and you just
checked _one_ of them.#

== Destined To Ever Meet?

[.slider]
* The *stack* starts at the top of the address space and grows ↓.
* The *heap* starts towards the bottom and grows ↑.
* *Will they ever meet?*
** *Probably not!* That would mean either the stack or probably the heap
was _huge_.

== Relocation

[source,c,role='small']
----
int data[128];
...
data[5] = 8; // Where the heck is data[5]?
...
result = foo(data[5]); // Where the heck is foo?
----

So given our address space model, no more problems with locating
things, right?

[.slide]
--
*Not quite!* Dynamically-loaded libraries still need to be relocated at
run time. Cool: but not something we'll cover in this course.

Sounds great

[.meme-bottom]
What's the catch?

== Address Spaces: A Great Idea?

[.slider]
* The address space abstraction sounds powerful and useful. (It would be
better if it cooked breakfast.)
* *But can we implement it?*

[.meme-top]
Your mission

[.meme-bottom]
Implement address spaces

== Implementing Address Spaces

[.slider]
.What's required?
* *Address translation*: 0x10000 to Process 1 is not the same as 0x10000
to Process 2 is not the same as...
* *Protection*: address spaces are intended to provide a _private_ view
of memory to each process.
* *Memory management*: together one or several processes may have *more
address space* allocated than physical memory on the machine.
** In a way, we are _encouraging_ processes to spread out and let us
handle the details.

[.nooutline]
== Guess What?

[.slider]
* Your entire (programming) life has been a *lie*.
* You believe in things that are *not actually true*.
* Today your view of the world will change forever.

0x10000
[.meme-bottom]
Also not real

== [.small]#Your Mission: Implement Address Spaces#

* Clearly implementing address spaces requires *breaking* the direct
connection between a memory address and physical memory.
* Introducing another *level of indirection* is a _classic_ systems
technique. We have seen it before. *Where?*
[.slider]
** *File handles!*

== Translation is Control

Forcing processes to *translate* a reference to gain access to the
underlying object provides the kernel with a great deal of *control*.

References can be [.slide]*revoked,* [.slide]*shared,* [.slide]*moved,*
[.slide]#and *altered*.#

== Memory Interface

We don't usually think about memory as having an interface, but it
does:

[.slider]
* `load(address)`: load data from the given address, usually into a
register or possible into another memory location.
* `store(address, value)`: store value to the given address, where value
may be in a register or another memory location.

== Virtual v. Physical Addresses

[.slider]
* The *address space* abstraction requires breaking the connection
between a memory address and physical memory.
* We refer to data accessed via the memory interface as using *virtual
addresses*:
** A *physical address* points to memory.
** A *virtual address* points to something that _acts like_ memory.
* Virtual addresses have much richer *semantics* than physical
addresses, encapsulating *location*, *permanence* and *protection*.

[.meme-top]
Welcome
[.meme-bottom]
To the real world

== Virtual Addresses: Location

The data referenced by a virtual address might be:

[.slide]
--
* *in memory*! (Duh.) [.slide]#But...the kernel may have moved it to the
_disk_.#

[.slide]#Virtual Address →# [.slide]#Physical Address#
--

[.slide]
--
* *on disk*, [.slide]#but...the kernel may be caching it in _memory_.#

[.slide]#Virtual Address →# [.slide]#Disk, Block, Offset#
--

[.slide]
--
* in memory on *another machine*.

Virtual Address → [.slide]#IP Address, Physical Address#
--

[.slide]
--
* a port on a *hardware device*.

Virtual Address → Device, Port
--

== Virtual Addresses: Permanence

Processes expect data written to virtual addresses that point to
*physical memory* to store values [.slide]*transiently*.

Processes expect data written to virtual addresses that point to
*disk* to store values [.slide]*permanently*.

[.slider]
.What about virtual addresses that point to *device ports*?
* Hardware may change its registers independently, so a read will not
necessarily return the last value written.

== Virtual Addresses: Permissions and Protection

[.slider]
* Some virtual addresses may only be used by the *kernel* while in
kernel mode.
* Virtual addresses may also be assigned *read*, *write* or *execute*
permissions.
[.slider]
** *read/write*: [.slide]#a process can load/store to this address.#
** *execute*: [.slide]#a process can load and execute instructions from this
address.#

== Creating Virtual Addresses: `exec()`

[.slider]
* `exec()` uses a *blueprint* from an ELF file to determine how the
address space should look when `exec()` completes.
* Specifically, `exec()` creates and initializes *virtual addresses* that
(mainly) point to *memory*:
[option='step']
** *code*, usually marked _read-only_.
** *data*, marked _read-write_, but not executable.
** *heap*, an area used for _dynamic allocations_, marked read-write.
** *stack* space for the _first_ thread.

== Creating Virtual Addresses: `fork()`

`fork()` *copies* the address space of the calling process.

== Creating Virtual Addresses: `fork()`

The child has the *same* virtual addresses as the parent but they
point to *different* memory locations.

[source,c,role='smaller slide replace']
----
int i = 2;
ret = fork();
if (ret != 0) {
  printf("%x", &i); // prints virtual address 0x20010
  i = 4;
  printf("%d", i);
} else {
  printf("%x", &i);
  i = 3;
  printf("%d", i);
}
----

[source,c,role='smaller slide replace']
----
int i = 2;
ret = fork();
if (ret != 0) {
  printf("%x", &i); // prints virtual address 0x20010
  i = 4;
  printf("%d", i); // prints 4. virtual address points to private memory.
} else {
  printf("%x", &i);
  i = 3;
  printf("%d", i);
}
----

[source,c,role='smaller slide replace']
----
int i = 2;
ret = fork();
if (ret != 0) {
  printf("%x", &i); // prints virtual address 0x20010
  i = 4;
  printf("%d", i); // prints 4. virtual address points to private memory.
} else {
  printf("%x", &i); // prints virtual address 0x20010
  i = 3;
  printf("%d", i);
}
----

[source,c,role='smaller slide replace']
----
int i = 2;
ret = fork();
if (ret != 0) {
  printf("%x", &i); // prints virtual address 0x20010
  i = 4;
  printf("%d", i); // prints 4. virtual address points to private memory.
} else {
  printf("%x", &i); // prints virtual address 0x20010
  i = 3;
  printf("%d", i); // prints 3. virtual address points to private memory.
}
----

== Issues with `fork()`

Copying all that memory is expensive!

[.slider]
* Especially when the next thing that a process frequently does is start
load a new binary which destroys most of the state `fork()` has carefully
copied!
* We will come back to this problem next week when we talk about *clever
memory-management tricks*.

== Creating Virtual Addresses: `sbrk()`

[.slider]
* Dynamic memory allocation is performed by the `sbrk()` system call.
* `sbrk()` asks the kernel to move the *break point*, or the point at
which the process heap ends.

== Creating Virtual Addresses: `mmap()`

[.slider]
* `mmap()` is a system call that creates virtual addresses that map to a
portion of a *file*.

== Example Machine Memory Layout: System/161

* System/161 emulates a 32-bit MIPS architecture.
* Addresses are 32-bits wide: from 0x0 to 0xFFFFFFFF.

.This MIPS architecture defines *four* address regions:
[.slider.small]
* `0x0–0x7FFFFFFF`: *process virtual addresses*. Accessible to user
processes, translated by the kernel. 2 GB.
* `0x80000000–0x9FFFFFFF`: *kernel direct-mapped addresses*. Only
accessible to the kernel, translated by subtracting 0x80000000. 512 MB.
Cached.
* `0xA0000000–0xBFFFFFFF`: *kernel direct-mapped addresses*. Only
accessible to the kernel. 512 MB. Uncached.
* `0xC0000000–0xFFFFFFFF`: *kernel virtual addresses*. Only accessible to
the kernel, translated by the kernel. 1 GB.

== Mechanism v. Policy

* We will get to the details of virtual address *translation* next time.

[.slider]
.However, it is important to note that *both* hardware and software are involved:
* The hardware *memory management unit* _speeds_ the process of
translation once the kernel has told it how to translate an address or
according to architectural conventions. The MMU is the *mechanism*.
* The operating system memory management subsystem manages translation
*policies* by telling the MMU what to do.

[.slider]
* Goal: system follows operating system established *policies* while
involving the operating system directly as rarely as possible.

[.nooutline]
== Next Time: Address Translation

* Multiple approaches to translating addresses.
* How to do it fast.
