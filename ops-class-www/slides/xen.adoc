== Paper Overview

[.slider]
.What kind of paper is this?
* A _big idea_ paper. (Why read any other kind?)
* Also a _wrong way_ paper.

[.slider]
.What's the wrong way?
* Full virtualization.

<<<

[.small]
____
Support for full virtualization was never part of the x86 architectural
design. Certain supervisor instructions must be handled by the VMM for
correct virtualization, but executing these with insufficient privilege fails
silently rather than causing a convenient trap. Efficiently virtualizing the
x86 MMU is also difficult. *These problems can be solved, but only at the cost
of increased complexity and reduced performance.*
____

<<<

[.small.spelling_exception]
____
Notwithstanding the intricacies of the x86, there are other arguments against
full virtualization. In particular, there are *situations in which it is
desirable for the hosted operating systems to see real as well as virtual
resources*: providing both real and virtual time allows a guest OS to better
support time-sensitive tasks, and to correctly handle TCP timeouts and RTT
estimates, while exposing real machine addresses allows a guest OS to improve
performance by using superpages or page coloring.
____

<<<

[.slider]
.So what's the big idea?
* Paravirtualization. Trade off *small* changes to the guest OS for *big*
improvements in performance and VMM simplicity.

[.small.slide]
____
We avoid the drawbacks of full virtualization by presenting a virtual machine
abstraction that is similar but not identical to the underlying hardware — an
approach which has been dubbed _paravirtualization_. This promises improved
performance, although it does require modifications to the guest operating
system. It is important to note, however, that *we do not require changes to
the application binary interface (ABI)*, and hence no modifications are
required to guest applications.
____

== Xen Design Principles

[.slider]
. "Support for unmodified application binaries is essential, or users will
not transition to Xen. *Hence we must virtualize all architectural features
required by existing standard ABIs.*"
. "Supporting full multi-application operating systems is important, as this
allows complex server configurations to be virtualized within a single guest
OS instance."
. "Paravirtualization is necessary to obtain high performance and strong
resource isolation on _uncooperative machine architectures_ such as x86."
. "Even on cooperative machine architectures, completely hiding the effects
of resource virtualization from guest OSes risks both correctness and
performance."

Xen introduces the idea of a _hypervisor_, a small piece of control software
similar to the VMM running below all the operating systems running on the
machine. Much of the typical VMM functionality is moved to control plane
software that runs inside a Xen guest.

== Virtual Machine Memory Interface

Virtualizing memory is hard, but it's easier if the architecture has

[.slider]
* a software-managed TLB, which can be efficiently virtualized; or
* a TLB with address space identifiers, which does not need to be flushed on
every transition.

[.slide]
--
Of course the x86 has neither of these features.

<<<

[.small.spelling_exception]
____
Given these limitations, we made two decisions: (i) guest OSes are
responsible for allocating and managing the hardware page tables, with
minimal involvement from Xen to ensure safety and isolation; and (ii) Xen
exists in a 64MB section at the top of every address space, thus avoiding a
TLB flush when entering and leaving the hypervisor
____

<<<

But how then do we ensure safety?

[.small]
____
Each time a guest OS requires a new page table, perhaps because a new process
is being created, it allocates and initializes a page from its own memory
reservation and registers it with Xen. *At this point the OS must relinquish
direct write privileges to the page-table memory: all subsequent updates must
be validated by Xen.*
____

<<<

[.small.spelling_exception]
____
Guest OSes may batch update requests to amortize the overhead of entering the
hypervisor. The top 64MB region of each address space, which is reserved for
Xen, is not accessible or remappable by guest OSes. This address region is
not used by any of the common x86 ABIs however, so this restriction does not
break application compatibility.
____

== Virtual Machine CPU Interface

[.small]
____
Principally, the insertion of a hypervisor below the operating system
violates the usual assumption that the OS is the most privileged entity in
the system. In order to protect the hypervisor from OS misbehavior (and
domains from one another) guest OSes must be modified to run at a lower
privilege level.
____

<<<

x86 privilege rings to the rescue!

[.small]
____
Efficient virtualization of privilege levels is possible on x86 because it
supports four distinct privilege levels in hardware. The x86 privilege levels
are generally described as rings, and are numbered from zero (most
privileged) to three (least privileged). OS code typically executes in ring 0
because no other ring can execute privileged instructions, while ring 3 is
generally used for application code. *To our knowledge, rings 1 and 2 have
not been used by any well-known x86 OS since OS/2.*
____

<<<

What exceptions happen enough to create a performance problem? [.slide]#Page
faults and system calls.#

[.small.slide.spelling_exception]
____
Typically only two types of exception occur frequently enough to affect
system performance: system calls (which are usually implemented via a
software exception), and page faults. We improve the performance of system
calls by allowing each guest OS to register a ‘fast’ exception handler which
is accessed directly by the processor without indirecting via ring 0; this
handler is validated before installing it in the hardware exception table.
____

== Para v. Full Virtualization

[.slider]
* Full virtualization: don't change the OS...[.slide]#except at runtime!#
* Paravirtualization: minimal changes to the OS, which sometimes results in
better interaction between the OS and virtual hardware.
